<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>The story of the 'childhood of our race' who inhabited
the counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire before the
Norman Conquest, is an almost blank page to the
popular reader of to-day. The last invaders of our
shores, whom we designate as the Danes and Norsemen,
were not the least important of our ancestors. The
History of their daring adventures, crafts and customs,
beliefs and character, with the surviving traces in our
language and laws, form the subject of this book.</p>

<p>From the evidence of relics, and of existing customs
and traditions, we trace their thought and actions, their
first steps in speech and handicraft, and the development
of their religious conceptions. Our education authorities
have realized the fact that "Local Names" contain a
fund of history and meaning which appeals to the young
as well as to the adults; and the county committees have
been well advised to recommend the teaching of History
and Geography from local features and events.</p>

<p>Some articles written by the late Mr. John Just, M.A.,
of Bury, on our early races, and elements of our language
and dialect, formed the incentive to the writer to continue
the story of our Danish ancestors.</p>

<p>To the following writers we are indebted for many
facts and quotations: H. Colley March, Esq., M.D.;
W.&nbsp;G. Collingwood, "Scandinavian Britain"; W.&nbsp;S.
Calverley, "Stone Crosses and Monuments of Westmorland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
and Cumberland"; Dr. W. Wagner's "Tales
and Traditions of our Northern Ancestors"; Mr. Boyle,
"Danes in the East Riding of Yorkshire"; Mr. J.&nbsp;W.
Bradley, B.A., of the Salt Museum, Stafford, "Runic
Calendars and Clog-Almanacs"; Rev. J. Hay Colligan,
Liverpool; Professor W.&nbsp;A. Herdman, Liverpool;
Mr. Jas. T. Marquis, of the Battle of "Brunanburh";

<p>Messrs. Titus Wilson &amp; Son, Kendal, Plates, "Map
of Races," etc.; Swan, Sonnenschein &amp; Co., London;

Manchester, for valuable advice and assistance grateful
thanks are now tendered.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Invasion and Conquest.</span></span></h2>

<p>A victorious people have always a wide-spreading
influence over the people subdued by them. An
inferior race never withstood a superior one. The
very fact that the Danes gained not only an
ascendancy in many parts of England during the
Anglo-Saxon dynasties, but even the government
of them all, is a proof that they were at that period
a race of individuals superior to the natives of the
land. The indigenous Britons felt the ameliorating
influence of the Roman superiority and the civilisation
which formed an element of the Roman sway.
The Danes exercised and maintained an influence
equal to the extent of their amalgamation for the
general good of the country. The Romans were
as much superior to the aboriginal Britons as the
English of the present day are to the Africans and
Sikhs. The Saxons were an advance on the
Romanised Celt, while on the Saxons again, the
Danes or Northmen were an advance in superiority
and a great element of improvement. Leaving the
Danes to tell their own tale and write their own
histories in favour of their own fatherland, we
undertake to sketch out their connection with our
own county of Lancaster, with the permanent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
still existing, effects of that connection. Hitherto
history has unfolded nothing as to the date when the
"Vikings" first visited the Lancashire coast,
plundering the county, and slaughtering the
inhabitants. The Danes first visited the eastern
coasts about the year <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 787, as narrated in the
Saxon Chronicle. In the year 894 the city of
Chester fell into their hands, under the redoubtable
Hastings. This celebrated place the Danes
fortified, and henceforward, along with the other
cities of Derby, across the island, held at intervals
until their power waned by the amalgamation which
eventually constituted one people. Local names
are the beacon lights of primeval history. The
names of places, even at this remote period of time,
suffice to prove that the Danes left an impression
of superiority by their invasion. At this time the
Danes invaded the coast of Lancashire, and formed
settlements therein. Cumberland and Westmorland
were under the dominion of Cumbrian Britons. At
this early period the Danes have so intermingled
with the Anglo-Saxons, as to influence the names
of the hundreds into which the shire was sub-divided.
No chronicle may register this fact, but the words
do, and will do, so long as they constitute the signs
and symbols of ideas and things. The northern
hundred of the shire was named Lonsdale, and
extended not only over the district of Lunesdale, but
also included the territory north of the sands. The
second hundred into which the shire was divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
was Amounderness. If we allow "ness" to be of
strictly Scandinavian origin, then this hundred has a
strictly Danish or Norse name, "Amounder" being
the first Viking who settled in the Fylde country.
Blackburn, pronounced "Blakeburn," is the third
name of a hundred which lies more inland, but
having little or no coast line within the shire. Inland
the Scandinavian influence diminished. Hence the
genuine Anglo-Saxon name of this division; in the
early times "Blagburnshire." The fourth hundred is
that of Salford, also inland, hence under no Danish
influence. The name is genuine Anglo-Saxon and
perhaps this hundred includes natives less mixed
with Scandinavian population than any other in the
north of England. The broad Anglo-Saxon frame
is seen to perfection in the country districts, and
the light, ruddy complexion. The men were made
for endurance and slow in movements. It would
be a difficult task to get them to move if they felt
disinclined to do so. The last hundred has much
sea coast, and came therefore much under Danish
influence. Hence the name, West Derby Hundred.
No one who knows anything of our early history will
hesitate to pronounce this name altogether Danish,
so that three out of the five hundreds into which the
county was apportioned were under Danish domination.
"Bi," Danish, in modern English "by," was
the common term given by Danish settlers to their
residence. Derby or Deorby means not the
residence or home of the deer, but a locality where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
the animals abounded. The Danes had, more than
any other people, a reverence for the dead.
Wherever a hero fell, even if but a short time
sufficed to cover his remains, this was done; and if
nothing better to mark the spot, a boat which
brought him hither was placed over him, keel uppermost.
Failing a boat, a "Haugr" or mound was
raised over his grave. When Christianity upset
these "Hofs," or sacred enclosures of Odin and
Thor, then crosses were erected over the Christian
graves. This accounts for the universal number of
"Crosbys" in the Danish district of the kingdom.
Conquered Rome converted and conquered its
barbarian and heathen masters to the Cross. Anglo-Saxon
converted his Danish neighbour, and subdued
him to the Cross. The higher the superstitions of
the Pagan the greater the devotee when he is
converted.</p>

<p>When the Danes were converted to Christianity by
their intercourse with the Anglo-Saxons they transferred
all their superstitious feeling to the emblems
of Christianity. Churches were also built by the
naturalised Danes in all places where they settled;
and just as easy as it is to recognise their dwellings
by their "bys," so it is to know the places where they
reared their churches. Their name for a church
was "kirkja." Hence in whatever compound name
this word enters as a component, there it indicates
a Danish origin. Hence Kirkby, Formby, Ormskirk,
and Kirkdale are places appertaining to the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Anglo-Danish history. Dale is likewise a genuine
appellative, as in Kirkdale as already noticed.
Besides, in this hundred we find: Skelmersdale,
Ainsdale, Cuerdale, and Birkdale. The only two
places which the Danes seem to have noticed in their
navigation of the Ribble were Walton-le-dale and
the more important Cuerdale, now renowned in
archæology for the richest find of ancient coins
recorded in history. The Danes brought a treasure
of 7,000 pieces to Cuerdale. Mingled with the
coins were bars of silver, amulets, broken rings, and
ornaments of various kinds, such as are recorded
by Scandinavian Sagas. Many countries had been
rifled for this treasure. Kufic, Italian, Byzantine,
French, and Anglo-Saxon coins were in the booty;
besides 3,000 genuine Danish pieces, minted by
kings and jarls on the Continent. Another discovery
of Danish treasure was made at Harkirke, near
Crosby. The coins here found were of a more
recent deposit, and contained but one of Canute the
Great. From the Mersey to the Ribble was a long,
swampy, boggy plain, and was not worth the
Romans' while to make roads or to fix stations or
tenements. From the Conquest until the beginning
of the 18th century this district was almost stagnant,
and its surface undisturbed. The Dane kept to the
shore, the sea was his farm. He dredged the coast
and the estuary, with his innate love of danger, till
Liverpool sprang up with the magic of Eastern
fable, and turned out many a rover to visit every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
region of the world. The race of the Viking are,
many of them, the richest merchants of the earth's
<span class="locked">surface.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></span></p>

<p>About half of England&mdash;the so-called "Danelag,"
or community of Danes, was for centuries subject to
Danish laws. These laws existed for 200 years
after the Norman Conquest. The Normans long
retained a predilection for old Danish institutions
and forms of judicature, and their new laws bear the
impress and colour of the older time. This is
established beyond doubt, in spite of the boast of
the famous Sir Robert Peel in Parliament, that he
was proud "The Danes tried in vain to overcome
the institutions of England instead of securing
them."</p>

<p>The English word "by-law" is still used to
denote municipal or corporate law, which is derived
from the Danish "By-Lov." This shows they must
have had some share in developing the system of
judicature in English cities. The "Hustings" were
well known in the seven cities under Danish rule.</p>

<p>The earliest positive traces of a "jury" in
England appear in the "Danelag," among the
Danes established there; and that long before the
time of William the Conqueror. The present village
of Thingwall, in Cheshire, was a place of meeting
for the "Thing" or "Trithing," a court held in the
open air to settle laws and disputes in the same
manner as that existing at Tynwald, Isle of Man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
The division of "Ridings" in Yorkshire is also
derived from this Danish custom.</p>

<p>The "Trithing" was a Danish institution, so also
was the wapentake. What are called "hundreds"
in some counties, are called "wapentakes" in others,
thus from the Norse "taka," which means a
"weapon grasping." Tacitus says the ancients
used to "express assent by waving or brandishing
their weapons." If the sentence pleased they struck
their spears together, "since the most honourable
kind of assent is to applaud with arms." From this
practice the word came to mean the sentence or
decree had been thus authenticated. "Vapantak"
in the grafas of Icelandic parliament means the
breaking up of the session, when the men resumed
their weapons which had been laid aside during the
assembly. (Cleasby.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Local Names.</span></h3>

<p>As a maritime race the Danes brought to our
county not only a knowledge of the sea, how to
navigate its perils, and the secret of successful
trading, but also possessed the art and craft of
shipbuilding to a higher degree than any then known.
We still have the old Danish name in Liverpool of
David Rollo and Sons, shipbuilders and engineers.
The following Danish maritime terms have become
part of our language: Vrag, a wreck; flaade, fleet;
vinde, windlass; skibsborde, shipboard; mast, mast;
seile, sails; styrmand, steersman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
From the fact that "Thingwall" in Cheshire and
"Tynwald" in the Isle of Man afford the memorial
of the assizes, and that "wald" or "vold" signifies
a "bank" or "rampart," where these courts were
held in order to be safe from surprise, may we not
presume the local name "The Wylde," in Bury, to
be derived from the same source, as the "bank" or
"rampart" would be used previous to the building
of the old castle? The Danish "byr," or "by,"
means a settlement, town, or village, and as the word
"berg" means a hill, and "borough," "bury,"
"brow," and "burgh" are similar terms for a
fortified hill, we may suppose "Bury" to be taken
from this source, instead of from the Saxon "byrig,"
a bridge, when no bridge existed.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Settlements.</span></span></h2>

<p>From the year 876 the Danes became colonists
and settlers. Raid and plunder gave place to
peaceful pursuits. The English Chronicle says
that in "this year Halfdene apportioned the lands
of Northumbria; and they henceforth continued
ploughing and tilling them." This colonisation of
Deira by the Danes was soon followed in other
districts. The greater part of central Britain with
the whole of the north and east came entirely under
Scandinavian rule.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/i_023l.jpg"><img id="ip_13" src="images/i_023.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="" /></a><br /><div class="caption">THE VIKING SETTLEMENTS</div></div>

<p>In 877 trading is recorded by the Sagas from
Norway, in a shipload of furs, hides, tallow and
dried fish, which were exchanged for wheat, honey,
wine and cloth. Thus early was established the
increase in comfort and wealth, as evidenced by
the erection of Christian monuments early in the
tenth century.</p>

<p>The origin of "long-weight" and "long-hundred"
count is traceable to the Danish settlements.
This peculiar reckoning survives in the
selling of cheese 120 lbs. to the cwt., and in the
counting of eggs, 120 to the hundred. The timber
trade counts 120 deals to the hundred. On the
East Coast fish are counted 132 to the hundred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Six score to the hundred is still popular in
Westmorland measure of crops and timber. This
Danish method of count was derived from the
Icelandic term "hundred" which meant 120.</p>

<p>Professor Maitland, in his "Domesday Book and
Beyond," says that the number of sokemen or free
men, owing certain dues to the Hundred Court, or
to a lord, who were masters of their own land, like
the customary tenants of Cumberland, was greater
in Norfolk and Suffolk than in Essex, and that in
Lincolnshire they formed nearly half the rural
population. At the time of Domesday the number
of serfs was greatest in the West of England, but
none are recorded in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.
In the manors bearing English names the sokemen
numbered two-fifths of the population, while in those
manors with Danish names they formed three-fifths
of the population. (Boyle.)</p>

<p>In the Danelaw they represent the original
freeholders of the settlement and owed obedience
to the local "Thing" or "Trithing Court." In
those districts which were not conquered by Edward
the Elder the freeholders settled and prospered,
and with the spread of Christianity they became
independent proprietors and traders.</p>

<p>The presence of Danish place-names marks the
district which they conquered, including the counties
of Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Leicester, Rutland,
and Northampton. In the rest of Mercia few of
these names are to be found, viz., in Cheshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Shropshire, Staffordshire, Worcester, Gloucester,
Hereford and Oxfordshire. The eastern part of
the Danish district came to be known as the Five
Burghs, namely, Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Stamford
and Nottingham. From the year 880 when
Halfdene divided the lands of Deira among his
followers the conditions of life became those of
colonists, and the Danes settled down to cultivate
their own lands, learning the language of the earlier
Angles, teaching them many words, and ways of
northern handicraft, and gradually intermarrying
and forming the vigorous character of body and
mind which denotes the modern Englishman.</p>

<p>From the middle of the tenth century men bearing
Anglo-Danish names held high positions in the
Church; Odo was Archbishop of Canterbury, his
nephew Oswald was Bishop of Worcester and
afterwards Archbishop of York in succession to
Oskytel, and many Norse names appear as witnesses
to Royal Charters.</p>

<p>The hatred still existed against these barbarous
Danes, and it is recorded in the Saxon Chronicle
that the Saxons learned drunkenness from the
Danes, a vice from which before they were free.
This character is strangely contrasted by the story of
John of Wallingford, that "they were wont, after
the fashion of their country, to comb their hair every
day, to bathe every Saturday, Laugardag, 'bath
day,'&mdash;and to change their garments often, and to
set off their persons by many such frivolous devices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
And in this manner laid siege to the virtue of the
women."</p>

<p>If we are to accept the evidence of Lord Coke,
we are indebted to the Danish invasion for our
propensity to make Ale the national beverage.
This eminent authority says that King Edgar, in
'permitting' the Danes to inhabit England, first
brought excessive drinking among us.</p>

<p>The word Ale came into the English language
through the Danish öl. At any rate after the
advent of the Norsemen, the English left off
drinking water and began to drink ale as the
regular everyday beverage of the people.</p>

<p>The term 'beer' was used by the Anglo-Saxons,
but seems to have fallen into desuetude until the
name was revived to distinguish 'ale' from
hopped ale.'&mdash;<i class="cite">From "Inns, Ales, and Drinking
Customs of Old England," by Frederick W.
Hackwood</i>.</p>

<p>Green the historian in his "Conquest of England"
says the names of the towns and villages of Deira
show us in how systematic a way southern Northumbria
was parted among its conquerors.... "The
English population was not displaced, but the lordship
of the soil was transferred to the conqueror. The
settlers formed a new aristocracy, while the older
nobles sank to a lower position, for throughout Deira
the life of an English thane was priced at but half
the value of a 'northern hold.'" The inference to
be drawn from this passage is that the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
lords of the soil were replaced by Danish ones, the
English settlers remained in possession of their
ancient holdings. In the course of time the two
races amalgamated, but at the Norman Conquest
this amalgamation had only been partially effected.
In the districts where the Danes settled they formed
new villages, in which they lived apart from the
general Anglian population. Had they not done so
the memory of their settlement could never have
been perpetuated by the Danish names given to their
homes. Every group of isolated Danish place-names
teaches the same fact, and there are many
such groups. This is the case in the Wirral district
of Cheshire, the peninsula between the Mersey and
the Dee, where we find such names as Raby,
Greasby, Frankby, Irby, Pansby, Whitby and
Shotwick, and in the centre of the district the village
called Thingwall. While throughout the rest of the
county scarcely a Danish name can be found, and as
these names were conferred by the Danish settlers
it is impossible not to believe that under analogous
conditions the names in other districts were conferred
in the same way. Where a new village was planted
midway between two older villages, its territory
would be carved in varying proportions out of the
lands of the earlier settlements. Sometimes certain
rights of the older villages were maintained in the
territory of which they had been deprived. Thus in a
Danish village of Anlaby, the lands whereof were
carved out of the adjoining townships of Kirk Ella<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and Hessle, the respective rectors of these parishes
had curiously divided rights to both the great and the
small tithes; whilst in the neighbouring instance of
the Danish Willerby, carved out of Kirk Ella and
Cottingham, the rector of Kirk Ella took all the
great tithes, and the rector of Cottingham took all
the small tithes. This method of Danish <i>village
formation</i> explains a curious point. The foundation
of the earlier Anglian settlements preceded the
development of the great road system of England.
Leaving out of consideration the Roman roads and
the comparatively few British roads, the former of
which have relation to nothing but the military needs
of that all conquering people, our existing road
system is due to the Anglo-Saxon. Our old roads
lead from one village to another and each village
is a centre from which roads radiate. The Danish
villages were, on the contrary, usually roadside
settlements. New settlements were formed on the
vast fringes of wood and waste which surrounded
the cultivated lands of the older English villages.
The road existed and the one village street was
formed along the line. Such wayside settlements
are Carnaby and Bessingby, on the road from
Bridlington to Driffield. When, as was sometimes
the case, the new settlement was planted at a little
distance from the existing road a new road running
at right angles from the old one and leading directly
to the settlement was formed. Skidby, Towthorp,
Kirby, Grindalbythe and many others are cases in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
point. One consequence of such conditions of
formation would be that where the English
settlements were most numerous the Danish
settlements would be few and small, because there
was less land available in such districts for their
formation. While, on the other hand, where
English settlements were more sparsely scattered
the Danish settlements would be more numerous,
and comparatively large. Taking a large district
like the East Riding, the average area of the
Danish townships may be expected to fall below
that of the Anglo-Saxon. The facts comply with
all these tests.</p>

<p>Thus to take the townships with Danish names,
and compare with similar districts of Anglo-Saxon
names, we arrive at the conclusion as to whether the
district was thickly populated before the coming of
the Danes. Many Anglo-Saxon villages are to be
found along the course of the Roman road, which
coincides with the modern one of to-day. The two
classes of population found only in Danish districts,
the Sochmanni and the "liber tenentes," are wholly
absent in purely English districts. Both held land
exempt from villain services, which was a condition
of tenure introduced by the Danes. This fact
shatters the theory of Green that English settlers
were communities of freemen. They were in fact
communities of bondmen, villains, bordars, cottars,
and serfs, the last holding no lands, but being bound
to the soil as chattels, and the rest holding their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
lands, "at the will of the lord," and in return for
actual services. What then was the Sochman?
The lawyer of to-day will answer, "He is one who
held land by 'socage,' tenure." Although in
Domesday this "sochman" is confined to Danish
districts, a fact which is recognised in the laws of
Edward the Confessor. After the Conquest a type
of tenure more or less closely corresponding to that
by which the earlier sochman held his land, was
gradually established over the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>Tenants who owned such tenures were called
"sochmen," and the tenure itself was called
"socage." A distinction was drawn between "free
socage" and "villain socage." The fuller development
of the feudal system which followed the
Conquest greatly complicated all questions of land
tenure. New conditions of holding superior to that
of "socage" were introduced. Thus in the pages of
Britton, who always speaks in the person of the
King, we read: "Sochmanries are lands and tenements
which are not held by knights' fee, nor by
grand serjeantries, but by simple services, as lands
enfranchised by us, or our predecessors, out of
ancient demesnes." Bracton is more explicit. He
defines free socage as the tenure of a tenement,
whereof the service is rendered in money to the chief
lords, and nothing whatever is paid, "ad scutum et
servitium regis." "Socage," he proceeds, "is
named from soke, and hence the tenants who held in
socage are called sochmanni, since they are entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
occupied in agriculture, and of whom wardship and
marriage pertain to the nearest parents in the right
of blood. And if in any manner homage is taken
thereof, as many times is the case, yet the chief lord
has not on this account, wardship and marriage,
which do not always follow homage." He then
goes on to define "villain socage." The essential
principle of socage tenure is rent in lieu of services.
It is to this fact no doubt that the vast impetus which
was given to the coinage of England soon after the
coming of the Danes is largely due.</p>

<p>As Mr. Worsaäe says, the Danish coiners
increased to fifty in number from the reign of
Aethelred to Edward the Confessor, and the
greater number exercised this vocation at York and
Lincoln. Thus the sochmanni were found only in
the settlements of the people who had created in
England a tenure of land free from servile obligations.</p>

<p>The manner of fixing these early settlements of
land was the same in Ireland, in the East Riding of
Yorkshire, and in Lincolnshire. The same custom
is still observed by our modern colonists who launch
out into the Australian bush. The land was staked
out by the settler from the highest ridge downwards
to the creek of the river or shore. By this means
the settler obtained on outlet to the open sea. The
homestead was built by the bondr or husbandman,
on the sheltered ground between the marsh and hill.
These settlements became byes, and were encircled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
by a garth, or farmyard. The names of some Norse
farms and settlements became composed of a Norse
prefix and Saxon ending. Thus we find Oxton
"the farm of the yoke," in the hollow of a long
ridge. Storeton, from stortun or "big field."</p>

<p>Many of these names are repetitions of places
which exist in Cumberland, Denmark, and the Isle
of Man. Raby and Irby were smaller farms on the
boundary of large byes, and were derived from the
Danish chief Ivar. Each homestead had its
pastures and woods, which are denoted by the
terminals "well," "wall," and "birket," found in
such names as Crabwall, Thelwall, Thingwall.</p>

<p>"Thwaites" or "Hlither" were sloping pastures,
cleared of wood, between the hill and marsh, used
for grazing cattle and sheep. This system of
agriculture is of Norse origin, and many such
"thwaites" are to be found in Wallasey, Lancashire,
and the Lake district. Calday and Calder, recorded
in Domesday, "Calders," derived from kalf-gard,
are names existing in Calderstones, at Wavertree,
and Calday near Windermere, as well as at
Eastham and in Scotland. Each large settler had
summer pastures for cattle on the highland or moor,
called "soeters" or "saetter," a shelter seat for the
dairymaids. From this custom we derive the names
Seacombe, Satterthwaite, Seathwaite, Seascale, and
Sellafield. As the population increased the large
estates were divided among the families of the early
settlers, and these upland pastures became separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
farms. Evidence that these early Norsemen were
Christians is found in the name Preston, in Domesday.
Prestune, the farm of the priest: who in these
early days farmed his own land. From its position
this farm became known as West Kirby.</p>

<p>The stone crosses of Nelson and Bromborough
prove that these churches were founded early in the
eleventh century.</p>

<p>The Danish character of Chester at this date is
shown by the fact that it was ruled by "lawmen,"
in the same manner as the Five Boroughs (vide
Round's "Feudal England," p. 465), and its growing
wealth and importance was due to the trading
intercourse through the Danish ships with Dublin.</p>

<p>Coming from the north-east another Norse and
Danish settlement sprang up round Liverpool.
Though we have no distinct historical record, the
place names indicate the centre was at Thelwall
(Tingwall). Such names are Roby, West Derby,
Kirkby, Crosby, Formby, Kirkdale, Toxteth, found
in Domesday as "Stockestede," Croxteth, Childwall,
Harbreck, Ravensmeols, Ormskirk, Altcar,
Burscough, Skelmersdale.</p>

<p>Out of forty-five names of places recorded in
Domesday in West Derby Hundred, ten are Scandinavian,
the rest might be interpreted in either
dialect.</p>

<p>All other names in Domesday in South
Lancashire are Anglo-Saxon, which only amount
to twelve: the reason for the small number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
names being that the land was for the most
part lying waste, and was thus free from assessment.
Thus we find on the present map that
Norse names form a large number which are not
recorded in Domesday. Many of these would be
later settlements. In West Derby the names of
three landowners appear in this survey with Norse
names, while three others are probably Norse, and
seven Saxon.</p>

<p>Following the fall of the Danish dynasty the
districts of South Lancashire formed part of
Cheshire and we find the names of six "Drengs"
around Warrington, possessing Norman names,
while only one bears a Norse name. The word
"Dreng" being Norse, would infer that the tenure
was of "danelaw" origin and not of Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>The founder of the Abbey of Burton-on-Trent,
Wulfric Spot, held great tracts of land in Wirral
and West Lancashire, which are named in his Will
dated 1002. Thus the "Bondr" here held his land
under Mercian rules, from which the hides and
hundreds were similar to those of the previous
"danelaw."</p>

<p>Lancashire was the southern portion of Deira,
which was one of the two kingdoms, Bernicia being
the other, into which the conquests of Ida, king of
Northumbria, were on his death divided. In
559 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> Ida died, and Aella became King of Deira,
and afterwards sole King of Northumbria, until
587 or 589. In 617, Edwin son of Ella was King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
of Northumbria, the greatest Prince, says Hume
the historian, of the Heptarchy in that age. He
was slain in battle with Penda of Mercia. In 634
the kingdom was again divided, Eanfrid reigning
in Bernicia, and Osric in Deira. Then Oswald,
saint as well as king, appears to have reunited the
two provinces again under his kingship of Northumberland.
Authorities, in more than one instance,
vary as to the exact dates, within a year or two.</p>

<p>The Saxon kingdom of Northumbria reached
from the Humber to the Forth, and from the North
Sea to the Irish Sea. For two centuries after the
death of Ecgfrith the Saxon king and the battle of
Nectansmere, history only records a succession of
plunder and pestilence.</p>

<p>Green the historian says "King after king was
swept away by treason and revolt, the country fell
into the hands of its turbulent nobles, its very fields
lay waste, and the land was scourged by famine and
plague."</p>

<p>The pirate Northmen or Vikings as they were
called first, began to raid the coast of England with
their fleets with the object of plunder. The English
Chronicle records their first attacks in the year 787.
"Three of their ships landed on the western shores,
these were the first ships of Danish men that sought
the land of Engle-folk."</p>

<p>The Monastery of Lindisfarne was plundered six
years later by their pirate ships, and the coast of
Northumbria was ravaged, Jan., 793.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
The following year they returned and destroyed
the monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow. This
was the beginning of the Norse raids on our Eastern
shores.</p>

<p>In 875 Halfdan returned from his campaign
against Alfred and the year after he divided the
lands of Northumbria amongst his followers. In
many parts we find groups of Scandinavian place-names
so close and thick, says Mr. W.&nbsp;G. Collingwood
in his "Scandinavian Britain," that we must
assume either depopulation by war, or the nearly
complete absence of previous population.</p>

<p>There is no reason to suppose that the earlier
Vikings depopulated the country they ravaged.
Spoil was their object and slaughter an incident.</p>

<p>As Canon Atkinson has shown in his "Analysis
of the Area of Cleveland under Cultivation at
Domesday Period," very little of the country in
that district was other than moor or forest at the
end of the eleventh century, and that most of the
villages then existing had Scandinavian names.
His conclusion is that these districts were a wilderness
since Roman and prehistoric days, and first
penetrated by the Danes and Norse: except for
some clearings such as Crathorne, Stokesley,
Stainton, and Easington, and the old monastery at
Whitby.</p>

<p>This conclusion receives support, says Mr.
Collingwood, from an analysis of the sculptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
stones now to be seen in the old Churches and sites
of Cleveland. It is only at Yarm, Crathorne,
Stainton, Easington, and Whitby, that we find
monuments of the pre-Viking age, and these are the
products of the latest Anglian period.</p>

<p>At Osmotherley, Ingleby, Arncliffe, Welbury,
Kirklevington, Thornaby, Ormesby, Skelton, Great
Ayton, Kirkdale, and Kirkby-in-Cleveland are
tombstones of the tenth and eleventh centuries. It
is thus evident that the Angles were only beginning
to penetrate these northern parts of Yorkshire when
the Vikings invaded and carried on the work of
land settlement much further. Further extension
was made by the Norse from the West Coast, as
the place-names show. Monuments of pre-Viking
art work exist at places with Scandinavian names,
such as Kirkby-Moorside, Kirkby-Misperton, and
Kirkdale; while in other cases only Viking age
Crosses are found at places with names of Anglian
origin, such as Ellerburn, Levisham, Sinnington,
Nunnington.</p>

<p>This would indicate that some Anglian sites were
depopulated and refounded with Danish names,
while others had no importance in Anglian times
but soon became flourishing sites under the Danes.</p>

<p>In the west of Yorkshire the great dales were
already tenanted by the Angles, but the moors
between them, and the sites higher up the valleys,
were not the sites of Churches until the Danish
period. (See "Anglian and Anglo-Danish Sculpture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
in the North Riding," by W.&nbsp;G. Collingwood.
<i class="cite">Yorks. Arch. Journal</i>, 1907.)</p>

<p>Yorkshire at the time of the Domesday survey
was carucated and divided into Ridings and
Wapentakes. Thingwall, near Whitby. (Canon
Atkinson, site lost.) Thinghow, near Ginsborough
(now lost), and Thinghow, now Finney Hill, near
Northallerton. (Mr. William Brown, F.S.A.)
Tingley, near Wakefield; Thingwall, near Liverpool;
Thingwall in Wirral, may have been Thingsteads.
(W.&nbsp;G. Collingwood.)</p>

<p>Names of places ending in -ergh, and -ark are
dairy-farms from setr and saetr. Names with ulls-
as prefix, such as Ulpha, Ullscarth, Ullswater,
record the fact that wolves inhabited the hills.</p>

<p>Beacons were kept up in olden days on hills
which bear the names of Warton, Warcop, Warwick
and Warthole. Tanshelf, near Pontefract, is
derived from Taddenesscylfe, Blawith and Blowick
from Blakogr&mdash;blackwood. Axle, Acle, arcle from
öxl, the shoulder.</p>

<h3 class="vspace"><span class="smcap">The Battle of Brunanburh.</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Was it Fought in Lancashire?</span></h3>

<p>"There is one entry in the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle which must be mentioned here as it
throws light upon an archæological discovery of
considerable importance. In 911 the Chronicle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
records that the Danish army among the Northumbrians
broke the peace and overran the land of
Mercia. When the King learned that they were
gone out to plunder, he sent his forces after them,
both of the West Saxons and the Mercians; and
they fought against them and put them to flight,
and slew many thousands of them...."</p>

<p>"There is good reason to believe," as Mr.
Andrew shows (Brit. Numis. Jour. i, 9), "that the
famous Cuerdale hoard of Silver coins, which was
found in 1840 in a leaden chest buried near a
difficult ford of the Ribble on the river bank about
two miles above Preston, represents the treasure
chest of this Danish army, overtaken in its retreat to
Northumbria at this ford and destroyed."</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Then follows a process of reasoning in support
of the above conclusion, based upon the place of
minting and the dating of the coins.</p>

<p>"The bulk of the coins, however, were Danish,
issued by Danish Kings of Northumbria, many of
them from York."</p>

<p>Besides the Cuerdale find of 10,000 silver coins
and 1,000 ounces of silver there are records given
of other Danish finds.&mdash;From the Victoria County
History of Lancashire, Vol. I., see Coins.</p>

<p>Each historian of this important event has
claimed a different site, in as many parts of
England. In Grose's "Antiquities" we find the
allied Scotch, Welsh, Irish, and Danes, the Northumbrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
army, under Anlaf were totally defeated,
in 938 at Brunanburgh (Bromridge, Brinkburn), in
Northumberland, when Constantine, King of the
Scots, and six petty Princes of Ireland and Wales,
with twelve Earls were slain. This description is
given in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The honour
of claiming the Lancashire site on the river Brun
near Burnley, belongs to the late Mr. Thomas
Turner Wilkinson, a master of Burnley Grammar
School, who claimed it for Saxifield in 1856.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. Jas. T. Marquis, a
member of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian
Society, for the following summary of evidence
which he placed before the above Society during
the winter session of 1908&ndash;9, and which will be
found recorded in the Transactions of the Society.
He says, "There is overwhelming testimony in
favour of the site on the Lancashire Brun."</p>

<p>The reasons for claiming this site are simply two.
An old writer spells Brinkburn&mdash;Brincaburh, and
there is an artificial mound proving a fight.</p>

<p>Camden gives Brunford, near Brumbridge in
Northumberland, as the place where "King Athelstane
fought a pitched battle against the Danes."
This might easily be, but not the battle we refer to.
There is no reason given except the word "ford."</p>

<p>Gibson suggests that it must have been "somewhere
near the Humber," although he finds a
difficulty in carrying Constantine and the little King
of Cumberland so high into Yorkshire. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
places suggested are Brumborough in Cheshire,
Banbury in Oxfordshire, Burnham and Bourne in
Lincolnshire, Brunton in Northumberland, but no
good reason beyond a name, and an embankment
in some cases, but not all. Brownedge in
Lancashire has been suggested, with excellent
reasons.</p>

<p>Dr. Giles and others suggest that the name
should be Brumby instead of Brunanburh. Ingram
in his map of Saxon England places the site in
Lincolnshire, near the Trent, but without assigning
good reasons. Turner observes that the "Villare"
mentions a Brunton in Northumberland, and Gibson
states what may still be seen in maps of a century
old, "that in Cheshire there is a place called
Brunburh near the shores of the Mersey." This
last would be a serious competitor if there was a
river Brun, or tumuli, or ford, or battlefield: but
nothing is claimed, only the name suggested.</p>

<p>Brunsford or Brunford. Let us first establish
the site of the "burh," which is a hill that shields
or protects a camp, town, or hamlet. The question
is, where was the "tun" or village on the Brun?
It was in Saxon times usual for the folk to settle
near a "burh" for the protection afforded by an
overlord who occupied it.</p>

<p>It was also the custom of the early missionaries
to establish a feldekirk by setting up a Cross near
to the hamlet, where they used to preach Christianity
and bury their dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Tradition says it was intended to build the
Church on the site of the Cross, but that God willed
it otherwise. God-ley Lane would be the lane
which led from the village in Saxon times to God's
Lea or God-ley, on which was the new church and
burial ground. Thus the new town would take its
modern name from the ground on which the Church
stood, namely Brun-ley, Bron-ley, and Burn-ley.</p>

<p>The cross, built in Saxon times to mark the spot
where Christianity was first preached, stood at the
foot of the "burh" near the Brun, and thus the
early name would be Brunford.</p>

<p>The records of Domesday Book contain no
mention of Burnley. To the east and west would
be the vast forest of Boulsworth and Pendle, while
the valleys would be marshes and swamps. The
ancient roads went along the hill sides, and there
is an ancient road from Clitheroe by Pendle passing
along the east side of the hill, now almost obliterated,
leading to Barrowford. The ancient road on
this east side of the valley, was on the Boulsworth
slope from Brunford, via Haggate and Shelfield,
to Castercliffe, Colne, and Trawden which gave its
name to the forest, and Emmott.</p>

<p>Dr. Whitaker tells us that in his day, "in the
fields about Red Lees are many strange inequalities
in the ground, something like obscure appearances
of foundations, or perhaps entrenchments, which the
levelling operations of agriculture have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
able to efface. Below Walshaw is a dyke stretching
across from 'Scrogg Wood' to 'Dark Wood.'"</p>

<p>The ninth century annalist says, "The Northmen
protected themselves according to custom, 'with
wood and a heap of earth,'" A Walshaw would
therefore be a wall of wood. Nothing was safer,
when attacked by bowmen, than a wood. Such was
the Brun-burh. This burh at Red Lees with
mounds and ditches, in a half circle on each side
of the Causeway, would have the same appearance
on being approached from the east and south-east
as the eleventh century "burh" at Laughton-en-le-Morthen
in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The ancient way referred to in Dr. Whitaker,
from Burnley to Townley, would be from the
Market Cross, along Godley Lane to the Brunford
Cross, up over the ridge to the top of Brunshaw,
along the Causeway to Lodge Farm, through the
Deer Park, through the Watch Gate at the foot of
the hill, and up to Castle Hill at Tunlay.</p>

<p>Although Egbert was called the first King of
England, his son Alfred the Great at the height of
his power only signed himself "Alfred of the West
Saxons, King."</p>

<p>England was still governed under the three provinces
at the time of Henry I., namely Wessex,
Mercia, and Danelagh. The latter province comprised
the whole tract of country north and east of
Watling Street. Mercia included the lands north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
of the Mersey. Danish Northumbria or Deira
comprised the lands to the west of the Pennines.</p>

<p>Amongst the hills north of the Ribble the hostile
nations could meet in security. Saxon-Mercia
north of the Mersey, surrounded by alien nations,
and having been itself conquered from that claimed
as the Danelaw, would be the most likely where
those nations could meet in time of peace, and was
the debatable land in time of war.</p>

<p>After the death of Alfred, when Edward the
Elder claimed overlordship, the Danes rose in
revolt in the north. It is recorded that he and his
warrior sister "the Lady of the Mercians" abandoned
the older strategy of rapine and raid, for that
of siege and fortress building, or the making and
strengthening of burhs.</p>

<p>Edward seems to have recovered the land
between the Mersey and the Ribble, for soon after
leaving Manchester, the Britons of Strathclyde, the
King of Scots, Regnold of Bamborough who had
taken York at this period, and the Danish Northumbrians
take him to be father and lord. The
place is not mentioned, but must be somewhere
between Boulsworth and Pendle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="ip_34" src="images/i_046.jpg" width="600" height="374" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">Extwistle Hall, near Eamott, marks an ancient boundary.</div></div>

<p>The same thing happened when Athelstan
claimed his overlordship. Profiting by following
his father's example, he would travel from burh to
burh, and his route would not be difficult to trace,
namely, Thelwall, Manchester, Bacup, Broad Dyke,
Long Dyke, Easden Fort, Copy Nook, Castle Hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Watch Gate, Brunburh, Broadbank, Castercliffe,
Shelfield, Winewall, Eamot.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that "<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 926,
Sihtric perished, and King Athelstan ruled all the
Kings in the Island, the Northumbrians, Constantine
King of Scots, Ealdred of Bamborough, and
others, which they confirmed by pledges and oaths at
a place Eamot on the 4th of the ides of July and
they renounced idolatry."</p>

<p>Everything points to the fact that Brunanburgh
gave its name to this battle. This part of the
Saxon king's dominions being the one place where
all the hostile nations could meet before the attack.</p>

<p>There is no other river Brun in northern Mercia,
and the Saxon Chronicle says the battle was fought
near Brunanburh.</p>

<p>Ethelward says Brunandune (river and dale).
Simeon gives Wendune (Swindon). Malmesbury
and Tugulf names Brunanburh or Bruford. Florence
of Worcester "near Brunanburh." Henry of
Huntingdon gives Brunesburh, and Gaimar has
Brunswerc, which we have in Worsthorne, which
is known to be derived from Wrthston, the town
of Wrth. In the <i class="cite">Annales Cambriae</i> it is styled
the "Bellum Brun" (the Battles of the Brun).
This would explain the many names.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury says that the field was
"far into England." We have Brownedge and
Brownside. In addition to all this we have
"Bishops Leap," S'Winless Lane, Saxifield, Saxifield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Dyke. We have also a Ruh-ley, a Red Lees,
directly opposite to which we have a traditional
battlefield and battlestone, also a High Law Hill,
and Horelaw Pastures, a number of cairns of stones,
a small tumuli; all of which may be said to be near
the hillfort Brunburh.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Descriptions of Battles from the Map.</span></h3>

<p>From the two Ordnance maps, "six inch to the
mile," one of Briercliffe, and the other of Worsthorne,
it may be seen that the roads from Slack,
near Huddersfield, pass through the Pennine range,
one by the long Causeway, on the south of the
position and on the southern side, near Stipernden,
is "Warcock Hill. From here running north, are
a series of ridges, Shedden Edge, Hazel Edge,
Hamilton Hill, to the other road from Slack, passing
through the hills at Widdop, and immediately
on the north side at Thursden is another Warcock
Hill. From Warcock Hill to Warcock Hill would
stretch the army of Anlaf in their first position.
From the north end of the position a road north to
Shelfield and Castercliffe, by means of which he
would be joined by his Welsh allies, from the
Ribble, via Portfield, and his Strathclyde and
Cumbrian allies from the north. From this end of
the position there is a road due west to the Broadbank,
where there is the site of a small camp at
Haggate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;"><a href="images/i_050l.jpg"><img id="ip_36" src="images/i_050.jpg" width="416" height="600" alt="" /></a><br /></div>

<p>From here Anlaf would send his Welsh allies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
under Adalis, and his shipmen under Hryngri, for
the night attack on the advancing Saxons as they
crossed the Brunford. They fell on them somewhere
on the site of Bishop's House Estate, but
were afterwards beaten back across the estates
known as Saxifield. Two days afterwards both
sides prepared for the great struggle near the burh,
and Anlaf, taking his cue from his opponent,
advanced his left and took possession of the hill
near Mereclough, afterwards called High Law
(Round Hill), and the pastures behind still known
as Battlefield, with a stone called Battlestone in the
centre of it.</p>

<p>Constantine and the Scots were in charge of the
hill, and the Pict, and Orkney men behind. His
centre he pushed forward at Brown Edge, to the
"Tun of Wrst." While his right touched
S'Winden Water under Adalis with the Welsh and
shipmen.</p>

<p>Two days before the great battle Athelstan
marched out of Brunburh at the north end, and
encamped somewhere on the plain called Bishop's
House Estate, his route by the Brunford, and
probably S'Winless Lane.</p>

<p>We are told that Anlaf entered the camp as a
spy, and ascertaining the position of Athelstan's
tent, formed the night attack for the purpose of
destroying him. Athelstan, however, leaving for
another part of his position on the Brun, gave
Wersthan, Bishop of Sherborne, the command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
The Bishop met his death somewhere on the
estate, the Pasture being known as Bishop's Leap,
which undoubtedly gave its name to the estate.</p>

<p>Adalis, the Welsh Prince, had done this in the
night attack, probably coming by way of Walshaw,
and Darkwood. Alfgier took up the command,
with Thorolf on his right and Eglis in support in
front of the wood. Alfgier was first assaulted by
Adalis with the Welsh and driven off the field,
afterwards fleeing the country. Thorolf was
assaulted by Hryngr the Dane, and soon afterwards
by Adalis also, flushed with victory. Thorolf
directed his colleague Eglis to assist him, exhorted
by his troops to stand close, and if overpowered to
retreat to the wood. Thorolf or Thorold the
Viking was the hero of this day, near the Netherwood
on Thursden Water. He fought his way to
Hryngr's standard and slew him. His success
animated his followers, and Adalis, mourning the
death of Hryngr, gave way and retreated, with his
followers back over Saxifield to the Causeway camp
at Broadbank.</p>

<p>Whatever took place at Saxifield the enemy left
it entirely, and the decisive battle took place at the
other end of Brunburh. In walking up S'Windene,
by S'Winden Water, the district on the right
between that river and the Brun is called in old
maps Roo-ley and in older manuscripts Ruhlie,
marked in Thomas Turner Wilkinson's time, with
a cairn and tumulus. Some distance further on we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
find Heckenhurst. The roads down from the burh
are at Rooley and at Brownside and at Red Lees
by the Long Causeway leading to Mereclough.</p>

<p>Athelstan placed Thorolf on the left of his army,
at Roo-ley, to oppose the Welsh and irregular Irish
under Adalis. In front of Brownside (Burnside)
was Eglis with the picked troops, and on Eglis'
right opposite Worsthorne, Athelstane and his
Anglo-Saxons.</p>

<p>Across the original Long Causeway on the Red
Lees, with the burh entrenchments immediately at
his back, was the valiant Turketul, the Chancellor,
with the warriors of Mercia and London opposite
Round Hill and Mereclough.</p>

<p>Thorolf began by trying to turn the enemy's right
flank, but Adalis darted out from behind the wood,
now Hackenhurst, and destroyed Thorolf, and his
foremost friends on Roo-ley or Ruhlie. Eglis
came up to assist his brother Viking, and encouraging
the retreating troops by an effort destroyed the
Welsh Prince Adalis, and drove his troops out of
the wood. The memorial of this flight was a cairn
and tumulus on Roo-ley.</p>

<p>Athelstan and Anlaf were fighting in the centre
for the possession of (Bruns) Weston, neither
making much progress, when the Chancellor
Turketul, with picked men, including the Worcester
men under the magnanimous Sinfin, made a flank
attack at Mereclough, and breaking through the
defence of the Pict and Orkney men, got to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
"Back o' th' Hill." He penetrated to the Cumbrians
and Scots, under Constantine, King of the
Grampians. The fight was all round Constantine's
son, who was unhorsed. The Chancellor was
nearly lost, and the Prince released, when Sinfin,
with a mighty effort, terminated the fight by slaying
the Prince.</p>

<p>On Round Hill, down to one hundred years ago,
stood a cairn called High Law. When the stones
were made use of to mend the roads, a skeleton was
found underneath. That would, I believe, be a
memorial of the fight.</p>

<p>At "Back o' th' Hill," a blind road leads through
what in an old map, and in tradition is called
"Battlefield," and the first memorial stone is called
"Battlestone." Another similar stone is further on.
Following the blind road through Hurstwood, the
Chancellor would find himself at Brown End, near
Brown Edge. At the other end of the position,
Eglis having won the wood, would be in the neighbourhood
of Hell Clough, ready to charge at the
same time as Turketul, on the rear of Anlaf's army.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="ip_40" src="images/i_056.jpg" width="600" height="378" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">Old Daneshouse</div></div>

<p>At this point of the battle, Athelstan, seeing this,
made a successful effort and pushed back the centre.
Then began the carnage, the memorials of which
are still to be seen on Brown Edge, Hamilton
Pasture, Swindene, Twist Hill, Bonfire Hill, and
even beyond. Those who could get through the
hills at Widdop would do so: others however
would take their "hoards" from the camps at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Warcock Hill and other places, and burying their
"treasures" as they went along, pass in front of
Boulsworth, and over the moor through Trawden
Forest, between Emmott and Wycollar.</p>

<p>If the Saxon description of the battle, in Turner's
"History of the Anglo-Saxons" be read and compared
with the Ordnance maps before named, the
reader will see that there is no other place in
England which can show the same circumstantial
evidence nor any place, having that evidence, be
other than the place sought for.</p>

<p>Danes House, Burnley, is thus referred to by the late
Mr. T.&nbsp;T. Wilkinson, F.R.A.S.:&mdash;"Danes House is
now a deserted mansion situated about half-a-mile to
the north of Burnley, on the Colne Road. It has been
conjectured there was a residence on the same site
<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 937, when Athelstan, King of the South Saxons,
overthrew with great slaughter, at the famous battle
of Brunanburgh, Anlaf, the Dane, and Constantine,
King of the Scots. Tradition states that it was
here that Anlaf rested on his way to the battlefield
from Dublin and the Isles, hence the name Danes
House. The present deserted mansion has undergone
little change since it was re-erected about the
year 1500." This house has now been pulled down.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dyke or Dykes, Broadclough, Bacup.</span></h3>

<p>This mighty entrenchment is over 600 yards in
length and for over 400 yards of the line is 18 yards
broad at the bottom. No satisfactory solution has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
yet been offered of the cause of this gigantic work
or of the use to which it was put originally. Speaking
of it Newbigging ("History of Rossendale")
<span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The careful investigations of Mr. Wilkinson
have invested this singular work with more of
interest than had before been associated with it, by
his having with marked ability and perseverance,
collected together a mass of exhaustive evidence,
enforced by a chain of argument the most conclusive,
with regard to the much debated locality of the
great struggle between the Saxons and the Danes,
which he endeavours, and most successfully, to
show is to be found in the immediate neighbourhood
of Burnley, and in connection with which the earthwork
in question constituted, probably, a not unimportant
adjunct."</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If Saxonfield (Saxifield) near Burnley, was the
scene of the engagement between the troops of
Athelstan and Anlaf, then it is in the highest degree
probable that one or other of the rival armies, most
likely that of the Saxon King, forced, or attempted
to force a passage through the valley of the Irwell
and that there they were encountered by the confederated
hosts intrenched behind the vast earthwork
at Broadclough that commanded the line of
their march. Whether this was taken in flank or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
rear by the Saxon warriors, or whether it was
successful in arresting their progress, or delaying a
portion of their army, it is impossible to determine;
but that it was constructed for weighty strategical
purposes, under the belief that its position was of
the last importance, so much of the remains of the
extraordinary which still exists affords sufficient
evidence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>An eloquent modern writer has declared, with a
good reason, that even if all other records had
perished, "anyone with skill to analyse the language,
might re-create for himself the history of the people
speaking that language, and might come to
appreciate the divers elements out of which that
people was composed, in what proportion they were
mingled, and in what succession they followed one
upon the other." From a careful analysis of the
names of the more prominent features of the land;
of its divisions, its towns and villages, and even its
streets, as well as the nomenclature of its legal, civil,
and political institutions, its implements of agriculture,
its weapons of war, and its articles of food and
clothing,&mdash;all these will yield a vast fund of history.</p>

<p>The place-name Liverpool has been the greatest
puzzle to local etymologists. From the earliest
known spelling&mdash;recorded in a deed of the time of
Richard I. 1189&ndash;99, where the form is Leverpool&mdash;to
the present, it has gone through more changes
than any other local name. As the Norse element
in the vicinity of Liverpool has been very great, we
may assume the original derivation to come from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
"hlith," the old Norse for a "slope." The north
dialect also contains the word "lither" meaning
sluggish. It is an adjective bearing the same
meaning as the modern English "lithe," pliant, or
gentle. The names Lithgoe, Lethbridge, Clitheroe,
and Litherland may be derived from it.</p>

<p>From the peaceful reign of Canute, or Knut,
we derive the nautical term, some place-names&mdash;Knuts-ford,
Knott End, Knot Mill, Knottingley.
Knot, from old Norse "Knutr," and "Knotta," a
ball, was the name given to the measurement of
speed of a ship. Fifty feet was the distance
allowed between the knots on the cord, and as many
as ran out in half a minute by the sand-glass
indicated the speed of the ship. And thus we speak
of a 10 knot breeze <span class="locked">blowing.<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></span></p>

<p>Hope, as a place-name, is common from the
Orkneys to the Midlands, and is derived from an
old Norse word "hoop," for a small land-locked
bay, inlet or a small enclosed valley, or branch from
the main dale. Hope is a common place-name, as
well as a surname. In compounds we find it in
Hopekirk, Hopeton, Hapton, Hopehead, Dryhope.</p>

<p>From "Trow," a trough, we derive Trowbridge,
Troughton, Trawden, and probably Rawtenstall.</p>

<p>The battle of Brunanburg, which took place in the
year 937, is supposed to have been fought on the site
of the modern Burnley, on the river Brun. King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Olaf brought his men over in 600 ships, many
containing over 100 men each. He was defeated
by Athelstane and his brother Edmund. There was
until recently pulled down in Burnley a house called
Danes-house. Though the Danes lost this battle,
the northern bards recorded its bravery in their war
songs, of which their Sagas or legends still preserve
some remains.</p>

<p>Among the chief followers of King Athelstane in
931, who subdued the Danish kingdom in England,
we find the names of the following Jarls: Urm,
Gudrum, Ingrard, Hadder, Haward, Healden,
Rengwald, Scule, and Gunner. It is not difficult to
recognise modern surnames from this list, such as
Urmston, Guthrie, Hodder, Howard, Holden,
Heald, Reynolds, Scholes, and Gunning.</p>

<p>"Northumbria was the literary centre of the
Christian world in Western Europe," says John
Richard Green; and the learning of the age was
directed by the Northumbrian scholar Baeda, the
venerable Bede.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Yorkshire.</span></h3>

<p>The population of Yorkshire, after the retreat of
the Romans, was composed of Angles.</p>

<p>When the Vikings invaded the county, the wide
dales only had been occupied by these early settlers.
The higher valleys were densely wooded, the broad
moors and mosslands had not been penetrated until
the coming of the Norse in 900 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></span></p>

<p>Some Anglian districts were refounded under
Danish names, and became flourishing settlements.
Canon Atkinson has shown by his analysis of
Cleveland, that at Domesday, very little of that
district was under cultivation. To the end of the
eleventh century it consisted of moor and forest,
and that many of the villages had then Danish
names. The name Ingleby shows the passing of
the Angles, by the addition of the Danish 'by.'</p>

<p>At Domesday Yorkshire was divided into Ridings
(thrithings), and Wapentakes.</p>

<p>Such names as Thingwall near Whitby, Thinghow
near Gainsborough, Thinghow near Northallerton,
and Tingley near Wakefield, though some of the
sites have disappeared, remain to show the centres
of Danish government. The presence of many
Scandinavian places and names suggests that the
country before then was a wilderness. The
condition of the country may be gathered from the
records and traditions of Reginald and Symeon of
Durham. In 875 Halfdan the Dane began his raid
into Bernicia, and the Abbot of Lindisfarne,
Eardwulf fled before him, taking the relics of
St. Cuthbert. These wanderings, says Symeon,
covered a period of nine years. The leader of this
band was Eadred, the Abbot of Carlisle (Caer-Luel),
whose monastery had been destroyed, and
with the city, lay in ruins for two hundred years.
At the places where these relics rested during their
wanderings, Churches were afterwards erected, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
dedicated to this Saint. The direction taken by the
fugitives has been traced by Monsignor Eyre and
the late Rev. T. Lees, first inland to Elsdon, then
by the Reed and Tyne to Haydon Bridge, and up
the Tyne valley; south by the Maiden way, and
then through the fells by Lorton and Embleton to
the Cumberland coast. At Derwentmouth, Workington,
they determined to embark for Ireland, but
were driven back by a storm and thrown ashore on
the coast of Galloway, where they found a refuge
at Whithorn.</p>

<p>Mr. W.&nbsp;G. Collingwood says in his "Scandinavian
Britain," that in this storm the MS. Gospels of
Bishop Eadfirth (now in the British Museum) were
washed overboard, but recovered. At Whithorn the
bishop heard of Halfdan's death, and turned homewards
by way of Kirkcudbright.</p>

<p>The fact that the relics of St. Cuthbert found
refuge in Cumberland and Galloway shows that the
Danish invasion, from which they were saved, took
very little hold of these parts. The Vikings of the
Irish Sea were already under the influence of
Christians, if not christianised, and were not hostile
to the fugitive monks, while the natives welcomed
them.</p>

<p>The early historians relate the curious story of
the election of Guthred, Halfdan's successor.
Eadred, Abbot of Carlisle, who was with St.
Cuthbert's relics at Craik, in central Yorkshire, on
the way home, dreamt that St. Cuthbert told him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
go to the Danish army on the Tyne, and to ransom
from slavery, a boy named Guthred, son of
Hardecnut (John of Wallingford says, "the sons
of Hardecnut had sold him into slavery"), and to
present him to the army as their king. He was also
to ask the army to give him the land between the
Tyne and the Wear, as a gift to St. Cuthbert and a
sanctuary for criminals. Confident in his mission,
he carried out its directions; found the boy,
ransomed him, gained the army's consent, and the
gift of the land, and proclaimed Guthred King at
"Oswigedune." Eardwulf then brought to the
same place the relics of St. Cuthbert, on which
every one swore good faith. The relics remained
until 999 at Chester-le-Street, and there Eardwulf
re-established the bishopric.</p>

<p>In these records of the Saxon historian Symeon,
we have the curious illustration of the Viking
raiders becoming rapidly transformed from enemies
into allies and rulers chosen from among them.
The history of Guthred's reign was peaceful, and
he became a Christian King. His election took
place about the year 880. During the reign of
Guthred, his kingdom became christianised, the sees
of Lindisfarne and York survived the changes.
Guthred died in 894 and was buried in the high
church at York.</p>

<p>In 919 Ragnvald, called by Symeon "Inguald,"
became King of York. He was one of the most
romantic figures of the whole Viking history. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
name bore many forms of spelling: Ragnvald,
Reignold, Ronald, Ranald, and Reginald.</p>

<p>Coming from the family of Ivar in Ireland,
Ragnvald mac Bicloch ravaged Scotland in 912,
fought and killed Bard Ottarsson in 914 off the
Isle of Man. Joined his brother at Waterford in
915 and set out for his adventure in North Britain.
Landing in Cumberland, he passed along the
Roman wall, and becoming King of York, was the
first of the Irish Vikings who ruled until 954.</p>

<p>The attacks of Vikings who were still Pagans
continued, and many curious lights are shed by the
chronicles of Pictish writers. The power of St.
Cuthbert over the lands given for a sanctuary to
Eadred the Abbot, is recorded in the legend of
Olaf Ball (from 'ballr,' the stubborn), a Pagan who
refused rent and service to St. Cuthbert, for lands
granted to him by Ragnvald, between Castle Eden
and the Wear. This Pagan came one day to the
Church of St. Cuthbert at Chester-le-Street. He
shouted to Bishop Cutheard and his congregation,
"What can your dead man, Cuthbert, do to me?
What is the use of threatening me with his anger?
I swear by my strong gods, Thor and Uthan, that
I will be the enemy of you all from this time forth."
Then, when he tried to leave the Church, he could
not lift his foot over the threshold, but fell down
dead. "And St. Cuthbert, as was just, thus got
his lands."</p>

<p>The succession of races which gave many of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
place-names, and the order in which they came, has
been pointed out in the following names by the late
Canon Hume, of Liverpool: Maeshir, now called
Mackerfield, was called Maeshir by the Britons,
meaning longfield; to which the Saxons added field,
which now becomes Longfield-field, Wansbeckwater
is Danish, Saxon, and English, three words meaning
water. Then we have Torpenhowhill, a hill in
Cumberland, composed of four words, each meaning
hill.</p>

<p>In addition to maritime terms, and terms of
government, we derive from Danish sources titles of
honour and dignity, such as king, queen, earl, knight,
and sheriff.</p>

<p>The Danes have left us traces of their occupation
in the word gate, which is of frequent occurrence,
and used instead of street in many of our older
towns. The Saxons, who were less civilised, left
many terms, such as ton, ham, stead, and stock.
But they had no word to denote a line of houses.
"Gata" was therefore not the English word used
for gate, but a street of houses. From the Norman
we have row, from rue, a street.</p>

<p>The names of many of our streets and buildings
are full of historical associations and information.
In Bolton, Wigan, and Preston we find some streets
bearing the name of gate, such as Bradshawgate,
Wallgate, Standishgate, and Fishergate. In the
towns of York, Ripon, Newcastle, and Carlisle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
many more of these gates are to be found. York
has no less than twenty gates.</p>

<p>To the roads of the Romans, the Danes gave the
name of "a braut," <i>i.e.</i>, the broken course, or cleared
way. (From this "a braut" comes the modern
English word abroad, and the adjective broad.) The
Anglo-Saxon took the name of street from the
Roman strata. Thus we get the name of Broad
Street, being two words of similar meaning.</p>

<p>Lone, lonely, and alone come from "i laun,"
which means banishment, and those thus outlawed
formed the brigands of the hill districts. We thus
get Lunesdale, Lune, and Lancaster, from which
John of Gaunt took his English title.</p>

<p>Skipper was the Danish term for the master
of a small vessel. In the game of bowls and
curling the skipper is the leader or director.</p>

<p>"Hay," the Norse for headland, pronounced hoy,
furnishes us with several local place-names, such as
Huyton, Hoylake, Howick.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Norse Festival.</span></h3>

<p>Trafalgar Day is celebrated by the usual
custom on October 21st&mdash;by the hoisting of the
British flag on the public buildings and by the
decoration of the Nelson Monuments in Liverpool
and London. This battle was fought in 1805, and
decided the supremacy of Britain as a sea power.
Long may the deathless signal of our greatest hero
continue to be the lode star of the man and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
nation: "England expects that every man will do
his duty."</p>

<p>Let us trace the connection between Lord Nelson
and the Danes in our own county. Admiral Nelson
bore a genuine Scandinavian name, from "Nielsen,"
and was a native of one of the districts which were
early colonised by the Danes, namely, Burnhamthorpe,
in Norfolk. His family were connected
with the village of Mawdesley, near Rufford, which
still has for its chief industry basket-making.
Fairhurst Hall, at Parbold, in the same district of
Lancashire, was the home of a Nelson family for
many centuries.</p>

<p>This recalls the fact that we have still in existence
a curious survival. "A strange festival" is
celebrated each year on January 31st at Lerwick, or
Kirkwall, the capital of the Orkney Isles. The
festival called "Up-helly-a" seems to be growing
in favour. Lerwick becomes the Mecca of the
North for many days, and young people travel long
distances to witness the revels that go to make up
the celebration of the ancient festival. All former
occasions were eclipsed by the last display. At
half-past eight o'clock a crowd of about 3,000 people
assembled in the square at the Market Cross. In
the centre stood a Norse war galley or Viking ship,
with its huge dragon head towering upwards with
graceful bend. Along the bulwarks were hung the
warriors' shields in glowing colours, the Norse flag,
with the raven, floating overhead. On board the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
galley fiddlers were seated. Then a light flared
below Fort Charlotte, which announced that the
good ship Victory would soon be on the scene.
And a stately ship she was, as she came majestically
along, hauled by a squad in sailor costume, while a
troop of instructors from the Fort walked alongside
as a guard of honour to the good vessel. The
Victory immediately took up her position, and the
guizers began to gather. Torches were served out,
the bugle sounded the call to light up, and then
the procession started on its way round the town.
The guizers who took part numbered over three
hundred, and seen under the glare of the torches
the procession was one of the prettiest. The Norse
galley led the way, and the Victory occupied a place
near the centre of the procession. The dresses
were very tasteful and represented every age and
clime. There were gay Cavaliers, Red Indians,
Knight Templars, and squires of the Georgian
period. The procession being over, the Victory and
the Norse galley were drawn up alongside each
other, near the market cross, while the guizers
formed a circle round them. Toasts were proposed,
songs were sung, and thereafter the proceedings
were brought to a close by the guizers throwing their
flaming torches on board the ships. As soon as the
bonfire was thoroughly ablaze, the guizers formed
themselves in their various squads, each headed by
a fiddler, and began their house to house visitation.
The guizer was costumed as an old Norse jarl, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
a sparkling coat of mail, and carried a prettily
emblazoned shield and sword. The squad of which
he was chief were got up as Vikings. Curiously
enough, these were followed by Dutch vrows.</p>

<p>The Orkneys and Shetland Isles were ceded to
James III. of Scotland, as the dowry of his wife,
Margaret, in 1469, and became part of Great Britain
on the union of Scotland with England. James I.
married Ann of Denmark, and passed through
Lancashire in August, 1617, when he visited
Hoghton Tower. The effusiveness of the Prestonians
was outdone at Hoghton Tower, where His Majesty
received a private address in which he was apostrophised
as "Dread Lord." He is reported to have
exclaimed "Cot's splutters! What a set of liegemen
Jamie has!"</p>

<p>We are sprung from the sea; a county of seaports
is our dwelling-place, and the sea itself our
ample dominion, covered throughout its vast extent
with our fellow subjects in their "floating cities."
These are filled with our wealth, which we commit
to the winds and waves to distribute to the extremities
of the four quarters of the world. We are
therefore no common people, nor are they common
events which form eras in our history; nor common
revolutions which have combined and modified the
elements of our speech.</p>

<p>Though we have kept no genealogies to record
to us from what particular horde of settlers we are
sprung&mdash;no family chronicles to tell us whether
Saxon, Dane, Norse, or Norman owns us as
progeny&mdash;still our names serve partly to distinguish
us, and "words" themselves thus still remind us
of what otherwise would be totally forgotten. It
has been claimed that two-thirds of us are sprung
from the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, and had our
language kept pace with our blood we should have
had about two-thirds of our modern English of the
same origin. But we have more. Our tongue is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
hence, less mixed than our blood. It is therefore
easier to trace out the histories of words than of
families.</p>

<p>It is difficult at first sight to determine whether
family names have been derived from family
residences or the residences have obtained their
names from their first proprietors. The Romans
imposed their military names upon the towns of the
early Britons. The Danes added their own descrip-names,
and previous to becoming converted to
Christianity gave the names of their heathen deities
to the mountains and landmarks. To these were
added the names of Norse and Danish kings and
jarls. After the Norman Conquest, when the land
had been divided by William the Conqueror among
his followers, comes the period when surnames were
taken from the chief lands and residences. Pagan
deities supply us with many surnames. From
"Balder" comes Balderstone, Osbaldistone. "Thor"
gives us Tursdale, Turton, Thursby, Thorley,
Thurston, and Thurstaston, in the Wirral, near West
Kirby. "Frëyer" supplies Frisby, Frankby, Fry,
Fryer, Fraisthorpe, and Fraser. "Uller" or
"Oller" gives Elswick, Ullersthorpe, Elston,
Ulverston. From "Vé," a sacred place, like
"Viborg," the old Jutland assize town, we derive
Wydale, Wigthorpe, Wythorpe, Willoughby, Wilbeforce,
Wigton, and Wyre. Some of our earliest
Lancashire names are derived from "Gorm,"
"Billingr," "Rollo," who were Norse and Danish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
kings. Their names and their compounds show us
that the Danes were Christianised, as "Ormskirk,"
which provides very many surnames, such as Orme,
Oram, Ormsby, Ormerod, Ormeshaw; and another
form of Gorm, "Grim" as Grimshaw and Grimsargh.
Formby and Hornby may also be traced to
this origin. From "Billingr" we get Billinge, the
village near Wigan, standing on a high hill and
having a beacon, Billington and other names of this
construction. From "Rollo" we derive Roby,
Raby, Rollo, Rollinson, Ribby. From "Arving,"
an heir, we get Irving, Irvin, and Irton. From
"Oter" we have Otter, Ottley, Uttley. The Danes
sailed up the river Douglas, and gave the name
Tarleton, from "Jarlstown." Many Christian
names come from the Danish&mdash;Eric, Elsie, Karl,
Harold, Hugo, Magnus, Olave, Ralph, Ronald,
Reginald. Surnames formed by the addition of
"son" or "sen" are common to both Danes and
English, but never appear in Saxon names. Thus
we have Anderson, Adamson, Howson, Haldan,
Matheson, Nelson, Jackson, Johnson, Thomson, and
Stevenson.</p>

<p>The different names we find given to the same
trees arise from different settlers giving and using
their own form of name: "Birch," "Bracken,"
"Crabtree," and "Cawthorn." "Wil-ding" is also
known in Westmorland and Yorkshire. "Whasset,"
which gives its name to a small hamlet near
Beetham, in Westmorland, is Danish; "Wil-ding"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
is probably Flemish, and also Wild, Wilde, as this
name dates from about the year <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1338, when
Edward III. encouraged numbers of Flemings to
come over from the Netherlands to introduce and
improve the manufacture of woollens. He located
them in different parts of the country, and we find
them settled in Kendal and in the vicinity of Bury
and Rochdale. This will account for this surname
being so frequently found in Lancashire.</p>

<p>From Copenhagen "the harbour of merchants," we
derive many important place-names and surnames.
A Copeman was a Chapman, a merchant or dealer;
and thus we derive Cheap, Cheapside, Chepstow,
and Chipping. In surnames we get Copeland,
Copley, Copethorne, and Capenhurst. The common
expression "to chop or change," comes from this
source. In the London Lyckpeny of 1430 we find:
"Flemings began on me for to cry 'Master, what
will you copen or buy.'" In 1579, Calvin in a
sermon said: "They play the copemaisters, and
make merchandise of the doctrine of this Gospel."
These early copmen remind us of the Lancashire
merchant who had visited the States after the
American Civil War. He said to the late John
Bright: "How I should like to return here, fifty
years after my death, to see what wonderful progress
these people have made." John Bright replied:
"I have no doubt, sir, you will be glad of any excuse
to come back."</p>

<p>To the abundance of surnames derived from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Danish origin the following are important:&mdash;Lund,
Lindsey, Lyster, Galt or Geld, and Kell. Lund
was a grove where pagan rites were conducted.
Lindsey is a grove by the sea. Lyster is Danish for
a fishing fork composed of barbed iron spikes on a
pole for spearing fish. Galt or Geld, an offering of
the expiatory barrow pig to the god "Frëyer."
From Kell, in Danish a "spring," we get Kellet and
Okell.</p>

<p>Surnames of a distinct Danish character, and
customs derived from Viking days are to be met
with in our local Fairs and Wakes. Writing on
this subject, the Rev. W.&nbsp;T. Bulpit of Southport
says that, "Robert de Cowdray, who died in 1222,
was an enterprising Lord of Manor of Meols, and
obtained a Charter from the King, with whom he
was a <i>Persona-Grata</i>, for a weekly Wednesday
market, and a yearly Fair, to be held on the Eve
and Day of St Cuthbert, to whom the church is
dedicated.</p>

<p>The Charter probably did but legalise what
already existed; Cowdray was a man of the world,
and knew that it would be an advantage to his
estate to have a fair.</p>

<p>Soon after his death the Charter lapsed. Enemies
said it interfered with pre-existing fairs.</p>

<p>Though legally it had no existence the fair continued
for centuries in connection with St. Cuthbert's wake
in March. It was also the end of the civil year,
when payments had to be made, and thus farm stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
was sold. This caused the market and wake to be
useful adjuncts, and a preparation for welcoming the
New Year on March 25th, St. Cuthbert's Day, the
anniversary of his death was held on March 23rd, and
a Viking custom demanded a feast. The old name of
the death feast was called Darval, and the name was
transferred to the cakes eaten at the wake, and they
were called Darvel <span class="locked">Cakes.<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></span></p>

<p>Long after the event commemorated was forgotten
Darvel Cakes were supplied in Lent to guests
at Churchtown wakes.</p>

<p>Connected with these fairs there was a ceremony
of electing officials, and at these social gatherings of
all the local celebrities a Mayor was elected who
generally distinguished himself by being hospitable.
Similar ceremonies still exist, where charters no
longer survive, at such places as Poulton near
Blackpool, and Norden near Rochdale.</p>

<p>Traces of the Norman are found in Dunham
Massey and Darcy Lever and a few others, but
along the whole of the east and north of the county
the Saxon and Danish landholder seems to have
held in peace the ancestral manor house in which he
had dwelt before the Conquest, and the haughty
insolence of the Norman was comparatively unknown.
Speke, the oldest manor house in South
Lancashire, near Liverpool, is derived from
"Spika," Norse for mast, which was used for
fattening swine. "Parr" is a wooded hill, and this
word enters into many compound names. "Bold,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
near St. Helens, signifies a stone house, and is the
surname of one of the oldest Lancashire families.
The Norse "Brecka," a gentle declivity, is much
in evidence in West Lancashire, as in Norbreck,
Warbrick, Swarbrick, Torbrick, Killbrick in the
Fylde district, and also Scarisbrick, in the vicinity
of Ormskirk. This name used to be spelt Scaursbreck,
and is a compound of "Scaur," a bird of the
seagull type, and "breck" from the natural formation
of the land. Birkdale, Ainsdale, Skelmersdale,
Kirkdale, Ansdell, Kirby, Kirkby, Crosby, are
all place-names of Danish origin which provide
many surnames in the county. Where Danish
names abound the dialect still partakes of a Danish
character.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">English Surnames.</span></h3>

<p>A great majority are derived from trades and
callings. Some may be traced from ancient words
which have dropped out. <span class="locked">"Chaucer"<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a></span> and
"Sutor" are now meaningless, but long ago both
signified a shoemaker. A "pilcher" formerly made
greatcoats; a "Reader," thatched buildings with
reeds or straw; a "Latimer" was a writer in Latin
for legal and such like purposes. An "Arkwright"
was the maker of the great meal chests or "arks,"
which were formerly essential pieces of household
furniture; "Tucker" was a fuller; "Lorimer" was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
a sadler; "Launder" or "Lavender," a washerman;
"Tupper" made tubs; "Jenner" was a joiner;
"Barker" a tanner; "Dexter," a charwoman;
"Bannister" kept a bath; "Sanger" is a corruption
of singer or minstrel; "Bowcher," a butcher;
"Milner" a miller; "Forster," a forester; a
"Chapman" was a merchant. The ancestors of the
Colemans and Woodyers sold those commodities in
former generations; "Wagners" were waggoners;
and "Naylors" made nails. A "Kemp" was once
a term for a soldier; a "Vavasour" held rank
between a knight and a baron. Certain old-fashioned
Christian names or quaint corruptions of them have
given rise to patronymics which at first sight appear
hard to interpret. Everyone is not aware that
Austin is identical with Augustin; and the name
Anstice is but the shortening of Anastasius. Ellis
was originally derived from Elias. Hood in like
manner is but a modern corruption of the ancient
Odo, or Odin. Everett is not far removed from the
once not uncommon Christian name Everard, while
even Stiggins can be safely referred to the northern
hero "Stigand." The termination "ing," signified
son or "offspring." Thus Browning and Whiting
in this way would mean the dark or fair children.
A number of ancient words for rural objects have
long ago become obsolete. "Cowdray" in olden
days signified a grove of hazel; "Garnett," a
granary. The suffix "Bec" in Ashbec and
Holmbec is a survival of the Danish "by," a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
habitation. "Dean" signifies a hollow or dell, and
the word "bottom" meant the same thing. Thus
Higginbottom meant a dell where the "hicken" or
mountain ash flourished. "Beckett" is a little
brook, from the Norse "beck." "Boys" is a
corruption of "bois," the French for wood.
"Donne" means a down; "Holt," a grove, and
"Hurst," a copse. "Brock" was the old term for
a badger, hence Broxbourne; while "Gos" in
Gosford signified a goose.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">On Dialect in Lancashire and Yorkshire.</span></h3>

<p>The district of England which during the
Heptarchy was, and since has been known by the
name of Northumbria, which consists of the territory
lying to the north of the rivers Humber (whence
the name North-humbria) and Mersey, which form
the southern boundaries, and extending north as far
as the rivers Tweed and Forth, is generally known
to vary considerably in the speech of its inhabitants
from the rest of England. Considering the great
extent and importance of this district, comprising as
it does more than one-fourth of the area and
population of England, it seems surprising that the
attention of philologists should not have been more
drawn to the fact of this difference and its causes.
From an essay on some of the leading characteristics
of the dialects spoken in the six northern counties of
England (ancient Northumbria) by the late Robert
Backhouse Peacock, edited by the Rev. T. C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Atkinson, 1869, we learn that, when addressing
themselves to the subject of dialect, investigators
have essayed to examine it through the medium of
its written rather than its spoken language. The
characteristics to be found in the language now
spoken have been preserved in a degree of purity
which does not appertain to the English of the
present day. It is therefore from the dialect rather
than from any literary monuments that we must
obtain the evidence necessary for ascertaining the
extent to which this Northumbrian differs from
English in its grammatical forms,&mdash;not to speak of
its general vocabulary.</p>

<p>The most remarkable characteristic is the definite
article, or the demonstrative pronoun&mdash;"t," which is
an abbreviation of the old Norse neuter demonstrative
pronoun "hit"&mdash;Swedish and Danish "et."
That this abbreviation is not simply an elision of the
letters "he" from the English article "<i>the</i>," which
is of old Frisian origin, is apparent from the fact
that all the versions of the second chapter, verse 1,
for instance, of Solomon's Song, "I am the rose of
Sharon, and the lily of the valleys," the uniform
abbreviation for all parts of England is the elision
of the final letter "e," making <i>the</i> into "th"; on the
other hand, out of fourteen specimens of the same
verse in Northumbria, eight give the "t" occurring
three times in the verse, thus, "I's t' rooaz o'
Sharon, an' t' lily o' t' valleys."</p>

<p>The districts where the Scandinavian article so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
abbreviated prevails are found in the versions to be
the county of Durham, Central and South Cumberland,
Westmorland; all Lancashire, except the
South-eastern district, and all Yorkshire; an area
which comprehends on the map about three-fourths
of all Northumbria.</p>

<p>The next leading feature is the proposition&mdash;i,
which is used for in. This is also a pure Scandinavianism,
being not only old Norse, but used in
Icelandic, Swedish and Danish of the present day.
Two instances occur in the 14th verse of the same
chapter, where for "O my dove, thou art in the clefts
of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, etc.,"
we have idiomatic version: "O my cushat, 'at 's i' t'
grikes o' t' crags, i' t' darkin' whols o' t' stairs."</p>

<p>Another word which occurs in six of the Northumbrian
versions is also Scandinavian, viz., the relative
pronoun <i>at</i> for <i>that</i>. From this illustration of a
short verse and a half of Scripture, we have established
the Norse character of the dialect as distinguished
from common English, of five of the most
ordinary words in the English language, namely,
the representatives of the words <i>the</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>art</i> and
<i>am</i>. These instances from the Etymology of the
Dialects help to establish the following canon:
That when a provincial word is common to more
than one dialect district (that is, districts where in
other respects the dialects differ from each other),
it may, as a rule, be relied upon, that the word is not
a corruption but a legitimate inheritance. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
referred to, we have seen, are the inheritance of a
whole province, that province being formerly an
entire kingdom.</p>

<p>Proceeding in the usual order of grammars, having
disposed of the article, we come next to the
<i>substantives</i>. These differ from the ordinary
English in that they recognise only one "case"
where English has two. The Northumbrian dialect
dispenses with the possessive or genitive case almost
entirely, and for "my father's hat," or "my uncle's
wife's mother's house," say, "my faddher hat," and
"my uncle wife muddher house." Upon which, all
that need be remarked is that they have gone further
in simplifying this part of speech than the rest of
their countrymen, who have only abolished the
dative and accusative cases from the parent
languages of their speech. Extreme brevity and
simplicity are eminently Norse and Northumbrian
characteristics. We have already seen some
remarkable instances in the versions of Solomon's
Song, where we saw that the first three words, "I
am the," are expressed in as many letters, namely,
"I's t'"; and again in verse 14, "thou art in the,"
by "at 's i t'." We have here another instance in
the abolition of the genitive case-ending, out of
many more that might be added.</p>

<p>In pronouncing the days of the week we find:
Sunnda for Sunday, Thorsda for Thursday, and
Setterda for Saturday, always with the short da.
The remaining days as in ordinary English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
In pronouns we find "wer" for "our," in the
possessive case, from old Norse vârr.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">Relative&mdash;<i>At</i> for who, which, that.</p>

<p class="in0">

<h3><span class="smcap">An Illustration.</span></h3>

<p>A good illustration of Danish terms may be
gathered from the following conversation heard by a
minister in this county between a poor man on his
death-bed and a farmer's wife, who had come to
visit him: "Well, John," she said, "when yo' getten
theer yo'll may happen see eaur Tummus; and yo'll
tell 'im we'n had th' shandry mended, un a new pig-stoye
built, un 'at we dun pretty well beawt him."
"Beli' me, Meary!" he answered, "dost think at
aw's nowt for t' do bo go clumpin' up un deawn t'
skoies a seechin' yo're Tummus!" The word
"mun" also is in frequent use, and comes from the
Danish verb "monne;" the Danish "swiga," to
drink in, as "to tak a good swig," and "Heaw he
swigged at it!" Many Danish words become purely
English, as foul, fowl; kow, cow; fued, food; stued,
stood; drown, drown; "forenoun" and "atternoun"
became "forenoon" and "afternoon;" stalker,
stalker; kok, cock; want, to want.</p>

<p>In popular superstition the races had much in
common. The Danish river sprite "Nok," imagined
by some to be "Nick," or "Owd Nick," the devil;
but properly "Nix," a "brownie." He wore a red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
cap and teased the peasants who tried to "flit"
(Danish "flytter") in order to escape him.</p>

<p>Though we have "Gretan," to weep, it also means
to salute or bid farewell, from the Danish "grata."
"Give o'er greeting," we hear it said to a crying
child. While "greeting" is a popular word of
Danish origin, so is "Yuletide" for Christmas, and
"Yule Candles," "Yule Cakes," "Yule Log."
The word "Tandle" means fire or light, and is
given to a hill near Oldham. From this we derive
our "Candle." "Lake," to play, is still used in our
district, but never heard where Danish words are not
prevalent. In the Danish, "Slat" means to slop,
and it is said, "He slat the water up and down."
A very common participle in Lancashire is "beawn."
The Danish "buinn" is "prepared," or "addressed
to," or "bound for," as "Weere ar't beawn furt'
goo?" In Danish and Lancashire "ling" means
heath; but it does not occur in Anglo-Saxon. From
the Danish "Snig," to creep, we get "snig," eels.</p>

<p>Locally we also have the name "Rossendale,"
which covers a large extent of our county. May we
not suppose this to be from "rost," a torrent or
whirlpool, and "dale," the Danish for valley?</p>

<p>The names of places beginning or ending with
"Garth," or "Gaard," shows that the people were
settling in "Gaarde" or farms belonging to the
chief, earl, or Udaller. With the Danish "Steen,"
for stone, we have Garston, Garstang, Garton, as
well as Garswood and garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
The Danish having no such sound or dipthong
as our "th," must account for the relic of the
pronunciation "at" for "that," which is much used
in our local dialect, as "It's toime at he were here,"&mdash;"at"
being the Danish conjunction for "that."
The word we use for sprinkling water, to "deg,"
does not come from the Anglo-Saxon "deagan,"
which means to dye or tinge with colour, but from
"deog" or "deigr." Shakespeare uses the word in
the "Tempest," where Prospero says: "When I
have deck'd the sea with drops full salt." From
"Klumbr," a mass or clod, we get "clump," as
clump of wood, and "clumpin' clogs." Stowe says,
"He brought his wooden shoes or clumpers with
him."</p>

<p>As early as the eleventh century the names of
English towns and villages are written in the
Domesday Book with the Danish ending "by" or
"bi," and not with the Norwegian form of "böer"
or "bö." This preponderance of Danish endings
proves the widely extended influence of the Danes
in the North. That they should have been preserved
in such numbers for more than eight centuries after
the fall of the Danish dominion in England,
disproves the opinion that the old Danish inhabitants
of the country were supplanted or expelled after the
cessation of the Danish rule (1042), first by the
Anglo-Saxons, and afterwards by the Normans.
Mr. Wörsæ says: "The Danes must have continued
to reside in great numbers in these districts,
previously conquered by them, and consequently it
follows that a considerable part of the present
population may with certainty trace their origin to
the Northmen, and especially to the Danes. The
general appearance of the inhabitants is a weighty
corroboration of the assertions of history. The
black hair, dark eye, the prominent nose, and the
long oval face to be found in the Southerners remind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
us of the relationship with the Romans, or a strong
mixture of the British Anglo-Saxon and Norman
races. The difference in physiognomy and stature
of the Northern races are also easily be recognised.
The form of face is broader, the cheekbones stand
out prominently, the nose is flatter, and at times
turned somewhat upwards. The eyes and hair are
of a lighter colour, and even deep red hair is far
from uncommon. The people are not very tall in
stature, but usually more compact and strongly built
than those of the South."</p>

<p>The still existing popular dialect is an excellent
proof that the resemblance of the inhabitants is not
confined to an accidental or personal likeness.
Many words and phrases are preserved in the local
dialect which are neither found nor understood in
other parts of the country. These terms are not
only given to waterfalls, mountains, rivulets, fords,
and islands, but are also in common use in daily
life. The housewife has her spool and spinning
wheel from "spole"; her reel and yarn-winder from
"rock" and "granwindle"; her baking-board from
"bagebord." She is about to knead dough, from
"deig"; and in order to make oaten bread, or thin
cakes beaten out by the hand, we have clap-bread
or clap-cake, form "klapperbröd" and "klapper-kake."
She spreads the tablecloth, "bordclaith,"
for dinner, "onden"; while the fire smokes, "reeks,"
as it makes its way through the thatch, "thack,"
where in olden times the loft, "loft," was the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
room or bower, "buir." Out in the yard or "gaard,"
is the barn, "lade," where is stored the corn in
"threaves." In the river are troughs, "trows," used
to cross over. These were two small boats, cut out
of the trunks of trees, and held together by a crosspole.
By placing a foot in each trough the
shepherd rowed himself across with the help of an
oar. He goes up the valley, "updaal," to clip,
"klippe," the sheep. It is said that Canute the
Great crossed over the river Severn in this manner,
when he concluded an agreement with Edmund
Ironsides to divide England between them.
Blether, from "Bladdra," is also a common expression,
meaning to "blubber or cry," to gabble or talk
without purpose. Another form of the word is
"bleat," as applied to sheep.</p>

<p>Other words now in use from the Norse are
"twinter," a two-year-old sheep, and "trinter," a
three-year-old. A "gimmer lamb" is a female
lamb. The lug-mark, <i>i.e.</i>, a bit cut out of a sheep's
ear that it may be recognised by the owner, is from
lögg mark." Lög is law, and thus it is the legal
mark. The "smit" or smear of colour, generally
red, by which the sheep are marked occurs in the
Bible of Ulphilas in the same sense as smear.
Another proof may be found on the carving in the
knitting sticks made and used by the Northern
peasantry of the present day. The patterns are
decidedly Scandinavian.</p>

<p>Of the people of this district, it may be said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
in their physical attributes they are the finest race
in the British dominions. Their Scandinavian
descent, their constant exposure to a highly
oxygenised atmosphere, their hereditary passion for
athletic sports and exercises, their happy temperament,
their exemption from privation, and many
other causes, have contributed to develop and
maintain their physical pre-eminence, and to enable
them to enjoy as pastime an amount of exposure and
fatigue that few but they would willingly encounter.
Thomas de Quincey, who lived thirty years among
them, observed them very closely, and knew them,
well, after remarking that "it is the lower classes
that in every nation form the 'fundus' in which lies
the national face, as well as the national character,"
says: "Each exists here in racy purity and integrity,
not disturbed by alien inter-marriages, nor in the
other by novelties of opinion, or other casual effects
derived from education and reading." The same
author says: "There you saw old men whose heads
would have been studies for Guido; there you saw
the most colossal and stately figures among the
young men that England has to show; there the
most beautiful young women. There it was that
sometimes I saw a lovelier face than ever I shall see
again." The eloquent opium-eater gave the
strongest possible proof that his admiration was real
by taking one of these "beautiful young women"
to wife.</p>

<p>The men of our northern dales do not pay much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
respect to anyone who addresses them in language
they are not accustomed to, nor do they make much
allowance for ignorance of their own dialect. In a
northern village we once stopped to speak to an old
lady at her door, and began by remarking that the
river was much swollen. "We call it a beck," said
the old lady, turning her back upon us, and telling
her granddaughter to bring out the scrapple.
"Whatever may a scrapple be?" we asked, deferentially.
"Why, that's what a scrapple may be,"
she said, indicating a coal-rake in the girl's hand.
As we moved away, we overheard her say to a
neighbour, "I don't know where he has been brought
up. He calls th' beck a river, and doesn't know
what a scrapple is!" They have a very quick sense
of humour, and often practice a little mystification
on inquisitive strangers. To a tourist who made the
somewhat stupid inquiry, "Does it ever rain here?"
the countrymen replied: "Why it donks, and it
dozzles, and sometimes gives a bit of a snifter, but
it ne'er comes in any girt pell," leaving the querist's
stock of information very much as he found it.</p>

<p>The first invasion of the Danes took place in the
year 787, and to Scotland they gave the name of
"Sutherland," and the Hebrides were the southern
islands, or "Sudreygar," a name which survives in
the title of the Bishop of Sodor and Man.</p>

<p>The Forest of Rossendale contains eleven
"vaccaries," or cow-pastures (we are told by Mr.
H.&nbsp;C. March, M.D.), which were called "booths,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
from the huts of the shepherds and cowherds.
From this we trace Cowpebooth, Bacopbooth, and
Crawshawbooth. Booth is derived from the old
Norse "bûd," a dwelling, while from "byr" and
"boer" we get the surnames Byrom, Burton,
Buerton, Bamber, Thornber. "Forseti" was the
judge of one of the Norse deities, and the word
supplies us with Fawcett, Facit, or Facid as it was
spelt in 1781, and Foster. Unal was a Danish
chief, whose name survives as a surname Neal, Niel,
and O'Neil. From the old Norse "yarborg," an
earthwork, we get Yarborough, Yerburgh, Sedburg,
and Sedberg. Boundaries have always been
matters of great importance, and "twistle" is a
boundary betwixt farms. Endrod was King of
Norway in 784, and his name furnishes Endr, whose
boundary becomes Entwistle, and also Enderby.
Rochdale is derived from "rockr," old Norse for
rock, and dale from the Norse "daal," a wide
valley; thus the Norsename Rochdale supplanted
Celtic-Saxon name of "Rachdam." "Gamul,"
meaning old, was a common personal name among
Norsemen. In a grant of land dated 1051, fifteen
years before the Conquest, appears the name of
Gouse Gamelson, which is a distinct Norse patronymic.
Gambleside was one of the vaccaries or cow-pastures
of Rossendale Forest, and was spelt
Gambulside. In Anglo-Saxon and Teutonic
dialects "ing" is a patronymic, as in Bruning, son
of Brun, says Mr. Robert Ferguson, M.P., in his
"Surnames as a Science." But it has also a wider
sense. Thus, in Leamington it signifies the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
of the Leam, on which river the place is situated.
From a like origin comes the name of the Scandinavian
Vikings, Vik-ing; the people from Vik, a bay.
Sir J. Picton, in his "Ethnology of Wiltshire,"
says: "When the Saxons first invaded England
they came in tribes, and families headed by their
patriarchal leaders. Each tribe was called by its
leader's name, with the termination 'ing,' signifying
family. Where they settled they gave their
patriarchal name to the mark, or central point round
which they clustered."</p>

<p>Considering the great number of these names,
amounting to over a thousand in England, and the
manner in which they are dispersed, it is impossible
to consider them as anything else than the everyday
names of men. This large number will serve to
give an idea of the very great extent to which place-names
are formed from the names of men who
founded the settlements. It must be remembered
that the earlier date now generally assigned for the
Teutonic settlements tends to give greater latitude
to the inquiry as to the races by whom the settlements
were made, as well as the fact that all our
settlements were made in heathen times. From the
neighbouring tribe of Picts we retain one form
"pecthun," from which we derive the surnames of
Picton, Peyton, and Paton. This may suggest that
we owe the name peat to the same origin. We have
also the word pictures, probably formed from
"pict," and "heri," a warrior.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Political Freemen</span></span></h2>

<p>Under the reign of Ethelred II. the supremacy of
the Anglo-Saxons had already passed away. As a
people they sank, and left only a part of their
civilisation and institutions to their successors, the
Danes and Normans. The development of a
maritime skill unknown before, of a bold manly
spirit of enterprise, and of a political liberty which,
by preserving a balance between the freedom of the
nobles and of the rest of the people, ensured to
England a powerful and peaceful existence.</p>

<p>Danish settlers in England conferred a great
benefit on the country, from a political point of view,
by the introduction of a numerous class of independent
peasantry. These people formed a striking
contrast to the oppressed race of Anglo-Saxons.
Turner says: "The Danes seem to have planted in
the colonies they occupied a numerous race of
freemen, and their counties seem to have been well
peopled." The number of these independent landowners
was consequently greatest in the districts
which were earliest occupied by the Danes, where
they naturally sprung up from the Danish chiefs
parcelling out the soil to their victorious warriors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Twenty years after the Norman Conquest there was
a greater number of independent landed proprietors,
if not, in the strictest sense of the word, freeholders,
in the districts occupied by the Danes, and under
"Danelag," than in any other of the Anglo-Saxon
parts of England. The smaller Anglo-Saxon
agriculturists were frequently serfs, while the Danish
settlers, being conquerors, were mostly freemen, and
in general proprietors of the soil.</p>

<p>Domesday Book mentions, under the name of
"Sochmanni," a numerous class of landowners or
peasants in the Danish districts of the north, while in
the south they are rarely to be found. They were
not freeholders in the present sense of the term.
They stood in a feudal relation to a superior lord,
but in such a manner that the "Sochmanni" may
best be compared with our present "hereditary
lessees." Their farm passed by inheritance to their
sons, they paying certain rents and performing
certain feudal duties; but the feudal lord had no
power to dispose of the property as he pleased.</p>

<p>The following is an abstract of a paper on Tithe
and Tenure in the North, by the Rev. J.&nbsp;H.
<span class="locked">Colligan:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Danish Influence on Land Tenure</span></p>

<p class="in0">was originally a military one. In Westmorland the
manors were granted round several great baronies or
Fees. The barons held their estates "in capite" from
the king, upon conditions that were mainly military,
while the lords of the manors held of the barons, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
chief duty being, to keep a muster-roll of their tenants
for the discharge of the military claims of the barons.
The tenants held of the lord by fines and services, the
latter being, until the close of the XVIth century, of a
military character. This baronial system, perfected by
William the Conqueror, gave enormous power into the
hands of the barons.</p>

<p>The Hudlestons, of Millum Castle, Lancashire, exercised
the prerogative of "jura regalia" for twenty-two
generations. They also had the privileges of "wreck of
the sea." Some of the barons had the power of capital
punishment, others, again, had the right to nominate
sheriffs. They held their own courts and could be either
friends or rivals of the king, to whom alone they owed
homage, with service at home or abroad. The authority
thus obtained by the barons was distributed to the
knights and lords of the manors, who, in their turn,
levied conditions upon their dependants.</p>

<p>This system of devolution of power received from the
king was enjoyed also by the church, and kept the
counties always ready for war. When the martial spirit
began to forsake the land, and peaceful and sporting
pleasures arose, we find a new form of tenure. Lands
and tenements are given for the apparently trifling
conditions of keeping up eyries of hawks for the baron,
or of providing a gilt spur, or of producing a rose,
sometimes out of season but generally in the time of
roses, or of making presents of pepper, ginger, cloves,
or some other tasty trifle. A number of these rents
require no explanation, as they are only the reflex of the
passion of the age. Horses, dogs and hawks for the
knight, pepper, ginger and cloves for the monks, are
easily understood. The reasons for the rose and stirrup,
the spur and the glove are not so apparent. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
possible that originally they were symbolical of real rent
or service. The transition from the actual to the symbolical
must have taken place in the XIVth and XVth
centuries.</p>

<p>We have hitherto been speaking of the relationship
between the barons and the monks, the knights and the
lords of the manor. There is no reference to tenants,
because there was no such thing as a free individual
tenure before the middle of the XVIth century. The
soldier-tenants clung round the barony of the manor, and
their position was defined as "tenantes ad voluntatem."
It was only in Elizabeth's reign that the demands of the
tenants began to be formulated, and the unique form of
tenure called "tenant right" appeared on the border.
It is difficult to discover when and how the movement
for freedom on the part of the tenants began, but it
certainly is associated with the Reformation, and is seen
plainly in those places where protestantism was vigorous.</p>

<p>We shall examine the growth of this form of tenure as
it appeared in a Cumberland manor. In the neighbourhood
under consideration we find three kinds of tenants.
At the one extreme were the Drenges, who were probably
Saxon slaves; at the other were tenants by right, who
were probably equal in dignity and privilege in the
early days to the lord of the manor himself. In
Cumberland and Westmoreland traces of the Drengage
tenements may be found, and the Bondgate, Appleby,
is an illustration of Drengage dwellings. The tenants
by right are found in Cumberland, where they are now
called yeomen, and in Westmorland, where they are
known as statesmen (steadsmen), and in North Lancashire,
where, to the regret of the writer in the Victoria
County History, the yeomen are gradually disappearing.
Mr. J. Brownbill says that tenant right was frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
urged all over Furness and Cartmel and in Warton and
the northern border of Lancashire. He refers to the
particulars in West's "Antiquities of Furness."</p>

<p>We have not been able to ascertain the origin of the
tenure as it applies to North Lancashire, but on the
borders it is the outcome of an interesting and unique
form of service called Cornage. It is still a disputed
point as to the origin of the word. Some holding it to
from the fact that the lord gave notice of the enemies'
approach by winding a horn; others that it was much
earlier in its origin, and arises from the horn or cattle
tax, still known in Westmorland as neat- or nowt-geld.
Whichever origin be taken, it is clear that, from the time
of Queen Elizabeth, the keeping of the borders was an
important service, and is seen from the fact that the
tenant could not hire another to take his place.</p>

<p>In regard to this border service, known as Cornage,
the lord had several privileges which included wardship
or control over the heir, until he was 21 years of age;
marriage, which gave him the right of arranging a
marriage if the inheritance had devolved upon a female;
and relief, which was the payment of a certain sum by
the heir upon taking possession of the inheritance. The
chief privilege which the "tenant-by-right" possessed
for his border service was that of devising his tenement
by <i>will</i>, a privilege which is much prized until this day.
At the Restoration the "Drengage tenure" was raised
into a Socage tenure, and it was under this tenure, with
that of Cornage, and sometimes with a combination of
these forms, that most of the tenements of the manors
of Cumberland and Westmorland were held. These
holders came to be described as customary tenants. The
customary tenant is distinguished from the freeholder,
and the copyholder, in that he is not seised of his land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
in fee simple, as is the freeholder, and is not subject to
the disabilities of the copyholder, nor are his customary
dues considered derogatory to the nobility of his tenure.
The customary tenant is therefore between the freeholder
and the copyholder, with a number of well defined
privileges. The two most important duties of the
average tenant in Cumberland and Westmorland were
those of warfare and the watching of the forests. The
former depended entirely upon the attitude of the other
kingdoms, especially Scotland; the latter was a long and
laborious service laid upon the tenant until the middle
of the XVIth century. The counties of Cumberland and
Westmorland were dense forests until long after the
Norman Conquest, and the timber for the royal shipyards
was grown in these highlands of England. The
forests were full of game, and the regulations in connection
with the preservation of game and the upkeep of the
forests were most exacting upon the people.</p>

<p>From the middle of the XVIth century, however,
these ancient laws and services began to lose their force,
and a new set of regulations arose to meet the new
environment. Slowly but surely the feudal system had
passed away. Here and there a relic remained, but it
was impossible to ignore the rights of men who could no
longer be bought and sold with a tenement. From the
first year of the reign of Elizabeth the border service is
well defined and the claims of the tenants became fixed.
Several years before, Lord Wharton, as Deputy-General
of the West Marches, drew up a series of regulations for
the protection of that part of the border. In an interesting
article by Mr. Graham, we find how the men of
Hayton, near Carlisle, turned out every night with their
spears, and remained crouched on the river bank in the
black darkness or the pouring rain. It is a typical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
example of borderers engaged upon their regular service.
This system had superseded the feudal system. The
feudal tenure survived in many instances where a power.
Like one of their own tumultuous forces, when once
directed into the right stream, they went to form that
new product which we call an Englishman. The documents,
which were discovered at Penruddock in the
township of Hutton Soil&mdash;the "kist" is in the possession
of Mr. Wm. Kitchen, Town Head, Penruddock&mdash;relate
to a struggle between the lord and the tenants of Hutton
John, Cumberland, on the subject of tenant right. So
far as we are aware these documents are unique. The
various authorities on Cumberland history give reference
to a number of these disputes but no mention is made of
the Hutton John case, so that we have here for the first
time a full knowledge of what was probably the most
important of all these trials. In addition, while there are
no documents relating to the other cases, we have here
every paper of the Hutton John case preserved. The
story of the discovery is that the writer (the Rev. J. Hay
Colligan) was searching for material for a history of the
Penruddock Presbyterian Meeting House when he came
across a kist, or chest, containing these documents. (A
calendar of these documents may be found in the
Cumberland and Westmorland Transactions for 1908.)
The manor of Hutton John had long been in the
possession of the Hutton family when it passed in 1564
to a son of Sir John Hudleston of Millum Castle by his
marriage with Mary Hutton. Her brother Thomas had
burdened the estate on account of his imprisonment
lasting about fifty years. It was the son of this
marriage, Joseph by name, who became the first lord of
the manor, and most of the manorial rights still remain
with the Hudleston family. After Joseph Hudleston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
came three Andrews&mdash;first, 1603&ndash;1672; second, 1637&ndash;1706;
third, 1669&ndash;1724&mdash;and it was with these four lords
that the tenants carried on their historical dispute.
The death of Thomas Hutton took place some time after
1620 and was the occasion for raising a number of
questions that agitated the manor for almost a century
afterwards. It flung the combustible topic of tenure into
an atmosphere that was already charged with religious
animosity, and the fire in the manor soon was as fierce
as the beacon-flare on their own Skiddaw.</p>

<p>The position of the parties in the manor may be
summed up by saying that Joseph Hudleston insisted
that the tenants were tenants-at-will, and the tenants on
the other hand claimed tenant right. Whatever may
have been the origin of cornage, it is clear that by the
XVIIth century it was synonymous with tenant right.
The details in the dispute cannot here be treated, but
the central point was the subject of a general fine. This
fine, frequently called gressome, was the entrance fine
which the tenant paid to the lord upon admittance. In
some manors it was a two years' rent, in others three.
An unusual form in the manor of Hutton John was a
seven years' gressome, called also a running fine or a
town-term. This was the amount of two years' rent at
the end of every seven years. The contention of the
tenants was, that as this was a running fine, no general
fine was due to the lord of the manor on the death of
the previous lord. From this position the tenants never
wavered, and for over seventy years they fought the
claim of the lord. Upon the death of Thomas Hutton
the tenants claiming tenant right refused to pay the
general fine to Joseph Hudleston. After wrangling with
the tenants for a few years, Joseph brought a Bill against
them in 1632. He succeeded in obtaining a report from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
the law lord, Baron Trevor, which plays an important
part in the case unto the end. He apparently disregarded
the portion which applied to himself, and pressed
the remainder upon the tenants. The tenants thereupon
decided to send three of their number with a petition to
Charles I. and it was delivered to the king at Newmarket.
He ordered his judges to look into the matter. The civil
war, however, had begun, and the whole country was
about to be filled with smoke and flame. Needless to
say the tenants took the side of Parliament, while the
lord of the manor, the first Andrew, was described in
the records as a Papist in arms. During the civil war
the whole county of Cumberland was in action. The
manor of Hutton John was mainly for the Parliament.
Greystoke Castle, only two miles from the manor,
surrendered to the Parliamentary troops. The termination
of the civil war in 1651 was the date for the
beginning of litigation between the Hudleston family
and the Parliament on the subject of the manor. After
this was over the struggle between the lord and the
tenants began again. In their distress the tenants sent
a letter to Lord Howard of Naworth Castle, whose
Puritan sympathies were well known. This is a feature
of the case that need not be dwelt upon, but without
which there can be no complete explanation of the story.
The struggle was in fact a religious one. The occasion
of it was the entrance into a Cumberland manor of a
Lancashire family, and the consequent resentment on
the part of the adherents of the manor, who boasted that
they had been there "afore the Hudlestons." The
motives which prompted each party were those expressed
in the words Puritan <i>v.</i> Papist. The year 1668 was a
memorable one in the history of the dispute. In that
year the tenants brought a Bill of complaint against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
lord at Carlisle Assizes. The judge, at the opening of
the court, declared that the differences could be compounded
by some gentlemen of the county. All the
parties agreed, and the court made an order whereby Sir
Philip Musgrave, Kt. and Bart., and Sir John Lowther,
Bart., were to settle the case before September 21st. If
they could not determine within that time they were to
select an umpire within one week, who must make his
award before Lady-day. Sir Philip Musgrave and Sir
John Lowther accepted the responsibility placed upon
them by the court and took great pains to accommodate
the differences, but finding themselves unable to furnish
the award within the time specified they elected Sir
George Fletcher, Bart., to be umpire. Sir George
Fletcher made his award on March 3rd, 1668. The
original document, written, signed and sealed with his
own hand, is here before us. Its tattered edges prove
that it has been frequently referred to. Sir George
Fletcher's award was on the whole in favour of the
tenants, and especially on the subject of the general fine,
which he declared was not payable on the death of the
lord. Other important matters were dealt with, including
heriots, widows' estates, the use of quarries on the
tenements, the use of timber, the mill rent, together with
the subject of boons and services. All the tenants
acquiesced in the award, and the lord paid the damages
for false imprisonment to several of the tenants.</p>

<p>In the year 1672 Andrew Hudleston the first died,
and Andrew the second, 1637&ndash;1706, succeeded to the
lordship. He immediately began to encroach. He
demanded the general fine in addition to rents and
services, contrary to the award. The struggle therefore
broke out afresh as fiercely as ever, and both parties
returned to the old subject of tenure. The matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
became a religious one owing to the Restoration and the
rigid acts which followed between 1662&ndash;1689. An
extraordinary incident occurred at this time in the conversion
of the lord to the protestant cause, but this did
not affect the dispute between him and the tenants. In
1699 the tenants moved again. They requested the court
to put into operation the award of Sir George Fletcher.
From that year until 1704 the strife was bitterer than
ever, and the kist contains more documents relating to
this period than to any other. In the year 1704, after
several judgments had previously been made against the
third Andrew Hudleston and his late father, the former
appealed to the House of Lords, and the case was
dismissed in favour of the tenants.</p>

<p>Although the struggle lasted until the year 1716, the
climax was reached in 1704. The historical value of the
case is the way in which it illustrates the conditions of
tenure in the North-West of England, and at the same
time pourtrays the pertinacity in spite of serious obstacles
of the yeoman class in asserting its rights.</p>

<p><i>Tithe.</i> The subject of Tithe is one that can only be
dealt with in a restricted way and from one point of view.
It is well known that, through the influence of George
Fox in North Lancashire, Quakerism spread with
frenzied force through Westmorland and Cumberland.
Many of those who had been previously content with
Puritan doctrines seceded to the Quakers. The practice
of declining to pay the tithe, in the case which the
documents before us illustrate, was of a different character.
It occurs in the parish of Greystoke, in which the
manor of Hutton John was situated. Five years after
the award of Sir George Fletcher on the tenure case, the
nonconforming section of the tenants of Hutton John
raised another question of a tithe called "Bushel Corn."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
This had been regularly paid to the Rector of Greystoke
from time immemorial. Even the Puritan rectors had
received this tithe down to that great Puritan, Richard
Gilpin, who was ejected from the Rectory of Greystoke
in 1661. The point in dispute was not a deliberate
refusal of the tithe, it was a declaration of the parishioners
that the <i>measure</i> was an unjust one. The contest
was carried on by John Noble, of Penruddock, and
Thos. Parsons, the steward of the Countess of Arundel
and Surrey, Lady of the Barony of Greystoke. Associated
with Parsons was John Robson, a servant and
proctor of the rector. Parsons and Robson were farmers
of the tithe, but the case had the full consent of the
rector, the Rev. Allan Smallwood, D.D.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of the dispute was the question
of the customary measure. It resulted in the settlement
of a vexatious subject which was as to the size of a
<i>bushel</i>. The matter was one of contention throughout
the country until standard weights and measures were
recognised and adopted. In Cumberland the most acute
form was upon the subject of the corn bushel. The
deviations in quantity were difficult to suppress, and
several law cases upon this matter are on record. In
the Parish of Greystoke the case was first begun in
1672. The bushel measure had been gradually increased
from sixteen gallons, which amount the parishioners
acknowledged and were prepared to pay, until it reached
twenty-two gallons. The case passed through the assizes
of three counties, being held at Carlisle, Lancaster and
Appleby, and a verdict for the parishioners was eventually
given.</p>

<p>The documents, apart from their intrinsic worth, have
thus an inestimable value, in that they shed light upon
and give information in regard to the doings in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Cumberland manor where hitherto there has been but
darkness and silence, as far as the records of the people
were concerned. We are able now to follow with interest
and satisfaction a story that is equal in courage and
persistence with the best traditions of English love of
justice and fair play.</p></blockquote>

<p>The documents in this case were numerous but
small, and were in many cases letters and scraps
of paper. As a piece of local history it is not to
be compared with the tenure case, but it contains
valuable items of parish life in the XVIIth century.
Perhaps the best of the letters are those from Sir
John Otway, the well-known lawyer. John Noble
the yeoman has several letters full of fine touches.
The depositions of the witnesses at Cockermouth in
1672 are picturesque. The lawyers' bills, of which
there are many, are not so illuminating. There are
several letters of Henry Johnes of Lancaster, who
was Mayor of that town on two occasions.</p>

<p>Public men regard it as a great honour to represent
the northern districts of England in Parliament,
merely from the intelligent political character of the
voters; and it was certainly through the adherence
of the love of freedom in the north that Cobden and
Bright were able to struggle so successfully for the
promotion of Free Trade and for financial reform.
Sir E. Bulwer Lytton, the great English writer,
says: "Those portions of the kingdom originally
peopled by the Danes are noted for their intolerance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
of all oppression, and their resolute independence of
character, to wit, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Norfolk,
and Cumberland, and large districts in the Scottish
lowlands."</p>

<p>Memorials of the Danes are mixed up with
England's freest and most liberal institutions; and
to the present day the place where the candidate
for a seat in Parliament addressed the electors bears
throughout England the pure Danish name of the
"Husting." When William I. began to conquer
England, and to parcel it out among his warriors, it
was the old Danish inhabitants who opposed him;
who would have joined him, their kinsman the
Norman, especially as he gave it out that one of
their objects in coming to England was to avenge
the Danes and Norwegians who were massacred by
Ethelred, but the Normans aimed at nothing less
than the abolition of the free tenure of estates and
the complete establishment of a feudal constitution.
This mode of proceeding was resented, which would
rob the previously independent man of his right to
house and land, and by transferring it to the powerful
nobles shook the foundation of freedom. The
Danes turned from them in disgust, and no longer
hesitated to join the equally oppressed Anglo-Saxons.
The Normans were obliged to build
strong fortifications, for fear of the people of
Scandinavian descent, who abounded both in the
towns and rural districts. What the Normans chiefly
apprehended was attacks from the Danes who, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
was good reason to suppose, might come over with
their fleets, to the assistance of their countrymen in
the North of England.</p>

<p>The Norman kings who succeeded William the
Conqueror dwelt in perfect safety in the southern
districts, but did not venture north without some
fear, and a chronicler who lived at the close of the
twelfth century assures us that they never visited
this part of the kingdom without being accompanied
by a strong army.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Abolition of Slavery.</span></h3>

<p>In those districts where the Danes exercised
complete dominion the custom of slavery was
abolished. This fact is established by a comparison
of the population of those districts colonised by the
Danes with that of the older English districts. The
population returns given in Domesday Book prove
that no "servi" existed in the counties where
Danish influence was greatest. Both in Yorkshire
and Lincolnshire at this time there is no record of
slavery. In the counties where this influence was
less, such as Nottingham, the returns show that one
serf existed to every 200 of the population. In
Derbyshire 1 per cent., in Norfolk and Suffolk
4 per cent., in Leicestershire 6 per cent., in
Northamptonshire 10 per cent., in Cambridge,
Hertford and Essex 11 per cent. Outside the
influence of the Danelagh the proportion is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
greater. In Oxfordshire 14 per cent. were slaves,
in Worcester, Bucks, Somerset and Wiltshire 15 per
cent., in Dorset and Hampshire 16 per cent., in
Shropshire 17 per cent., in Devonshire 18 per cent.,
in Cornwall 21 per cent., and in Gloucestershire
24 per cent., or almost one-fourth of the whole
population. These records were not made by
Danish surveyors, but Norman officials, and explode
the theory of historians like Green who assert that
the English settlers were Communities of free men.
These conditions of tenure were introduced by the
Danes, and became so firmly established that the
names given to such freeholders as "statesmen" in
Cumberland, "freemen" and "yeomen" in
Yorkshire, Westmorland and North Lancashire still
exist at the present day.</p>

<p>As we have seen, records of struggles for tenant
rights have come to light in recent years which prove
that feudal conditions were imposed by successive
landlords, and were resisted both before and after
the Commonwealth.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Invasion and Settlement.</span></h3>

<p>The Norse settlement at the mouth of the Dee
dated from the year 900 when Ingimund, who had
been expelled from Dublin, was given certain waste
lands near Chester, by Aethelflaed, Lady of the
Mercians. This colony extended from the shore of
Flint, over the Wirral peninsula to the Mersey, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
it is recorded in Domesday by the name of their
Thingwall or Tingvella. Along with the group of
Norse names in the Wirral is Thurstaston, or
Thors-Stone, or Thorstun-tun. This natural
formation of red sandstone has been sometimes
mistaken for a Tingmount or Norse monument.
Several monuments of the tenth century Norse
colony are to be found in the district, such as the
Hogback Stone in West Kirby Museum, and the
gravestone bearing the wheel-shaped head. A
similar monument was found on Hilbre Island, and
other remains of cross slabs occur at Neston and
Bromborough.</p>

<p>The Norse place-names of Wirral prove that
these lands were waste and unoccupied, when names
of Danish origin were given, such as Helsby,
Frankby, Whitby, Raby, Irby, Greasby and Pensby.
Some Wirral names are composed of Celtic and
Norse, as the settlers brought both Gælic and Norse
names from Ireland. These are found in the
Norse Runes in the Isle of Man and north of
Lancaster.</p>

<p>Socmen were manorial tenants who were free in
status, though their land was not held by charter,
like that of a freeholder, but was secured to them
by custom. They paid a fixed rent for the virgate,
or part of a virgate, which they generally held; and,
taking the Peterborough Socmen as examples, they
were bound to render farm produce, such as fowls
and eggs, at stated seasons; to lend their plough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
teams thrice in winter and spring; to mow and carry
hay; to thresh and harrow, and do other farm work
for one day ... and to help at the harvest for one
or two days. Their services contrasted with the
<i>week-work</i> of a villein, were little more than nominal
and are comparable to those of the Radmanni.
The Peterborough socmen reappear under the
"Descriptio Militum" of the abbey, where it is said
they were served "cum militibus," but this appears to
be exceptional. Socmen were like "liber tenentes"
frequently liable to "merchet, heriot and tallage."
Their tenure was the origin of free socage, common
in the thirteenth century, and now the prevailing
tenure of land in England. Socmen held land by a
fixed money payment, and by a fixed though trivial
amount of base service which would seem to
ultimately disappear by commutation." All socmen
as customary tenants required the intervention of
the steward of the manor in the transfer or sale of
their rights. ("Palgrave's Dictionary of Political
Economy," p. 439.)</p>

<p><i>Merchet.</i> Of all the manorial exactions the
most odious was the "Merchetum," a fine paid by
the villain on giving his daughter in marriage. It was
considered as a mark of servile descent, and the man
free by blood was supposed to be always exempted
from it, however debased his position was in every
other respect.</p>

<p>In the status of socmen, developed from the law
of Saxon freemen there was usually nothing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
kind. "Heriot" was the fine or tax payable to the
lord or abbot on the death of the socman. The true
Heriot is akin in name and in character to the Saxon
"here-great"&mdash;to the surrender of the military outfit
supplied by the chief to his follower. In feudal
time and among peasants it is not the war-horse and
armour that is meant, but the ox and harness take
their place. (Vinogradoff, "Mediæval Manors":
Political Exactions, Chap. V., 153.)</p>

<p><i>Mol-men.</i> Etymologically, there is reason to
believe that this term is of Danish origin, and the
meaning has been kept in practice by the Scotch
dialect (<i>vide</i> "Ashley, Economic History," i, pp.
56&ndash;87.)</p>

<p><i>Tallage.</i> The payment of arbitrary tallage is
held during the thirteenth century to imply a servile
status. Such tallage at will is not very often found
in documents, although the lord sometimes retained
his prerogative in this respect even when sanctioning
the customary form of renders and services. Now
and then it is mentioned that tallage is to be levied
once a year although the amount remains uncertain.
("Villianage in England," Chap. v, 163, Vinogradoff.)</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Husbandry.</span></span></h2>

<p>The influence of the Norse has been felt in terms
connected with land. "God speed the plough" has
been the toast of many a cup at many a merry meeting
for many a century past in this realm. Yet we seem
not generally to know by whom the name of the
plough was introduced amongst us. The Anglo-Saxon
knew nothing of such an implement and its
uses ere they settled in the land. This is apparent
from their not having a term for it in their own
tongue. Even when they were accustomed to the
use of the so-called plough of the Romans, which
they found in the hands of the British at their settlement
in the country, they so confounded the terms of
husbandry that they gave the name of "syl" or
"suhl" to the Roman-British implement, from the
furrow "sulcus," which it drew, without attending
in the least to the Roman-British name. The work
of one such plough during a season they have called
a "sulling" or furrowing.</p>

<p>This so-called plough, from the figures left of it
in the Anglo-Saxon MSS., seems to have been but
a sorry kind of an article, not fit to be brought into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
comparison with the worst form of our plough in the
neglected districts of England. We owe both the
framework and the origin of the modern plough to
the Northerners. We meet with the word in the old
Norse "plogr." In Swedish it is "plog"; while in
Danish it occurs both as "plov" and "ploug," as in
English, and it was in all probability introduced by
that people during the eleventh century, at the latter
part of their dynasty within the island. There is no
root either in the Teutonic or Scandinavian tongues
from which it is deducible. The British name for
their plough was "aradr," their mode of pronouncing
the Latin "aratum," the word for the Roman
plough. The sort of agriculture which was known
in the very early times must have been extremely
simple, if we are to judge it by the terms which have
reached our times.</p>

<p>Ulphilas, in his translation of the Greek Testament
construes the word for plough with the Gothic
word "hôha," the origin of our modern term "hoe."
We may therefore surmise that in these primitive
times natives hoed the ground for their crops for
want of better implements to turn up the soil.</p>

<p>While we owe to the Norse the name for plough,
we are also indebted to them for the term
"husbandry." Among the Scandinavians, the
common name for the peasantry was "bondi," the
abstract form of "buondi," dwelling in, or inhabiting
a country. As intercourse with more civilised nations
began to civilise the inhabitants of these northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
climes, certain favoured "bondi" had houses
assigned to them, with plots of ground adjoining
for the use of their families. As the culture of such
private plots was distinct from the common culture
of other land, the person so favoured, separated
from the general herd, obtained the name of
"husbondi," and the culture of their grounds
"husbondri." When such families obtained settlements
in England, they brought over with them the
habits and names of the North; and from mingling
with the Anglo-Saxon natives, with whom adjuncts
to introduced terms and titles were common, the
suffix of "man" was applied to the name of
"husbondi," who thus became "husbandmen," a
term still kept up in the northern counties for
labourers on farms, who are styled husbandmen to
this day.</p>

<p>Names from trades and handicrafts were given
to persons employed therein both by Danes and
Anglo-Saxons. Such names keep up their distinction
to the present day. The general name of
artizans of every kind was Smith. Simple "Smiths"
are Anglo-Saxon, "Smithies" are Norse. "Millars,"
from the trade of millers, are Anglo-Saxon.
"Milners" for the same reason are Norse. "Ulls,"
"Woolley" is Anglo-Saxon, "Woolner" is Norse;
"Fullers" and "Towers" are Anglo-Saxon;
"Kilners" and "Gardners," Norse. Some names
derived from offices as "Gotts" from "Gopr," a
priest, or one who had charge of a "hof," or heathen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
temple in the north. "Goods" comes from "Gopa,"
and "barge" from "bargr."</p>

<p>As further instances we may notice the names of
buildings. "Bigging," applied to a building, shows
it to be Norse, as in "Newbiggin" and "Dearsbiggin."
Such buildings were built of timber, and
had an opening for the door and an eyelet for a
window. In the Norse this opening was called
"vindanga," or windeye, which term we have
adopted, and modernised it into our word "window."
We have also chosen several Norse names for our
domesticated animals. "Bull" we have formed
from the Norse "bole." "Gommer," or "Gimmer"
we retain in the northern dialect for ewe lamb, from
the Norse "Gimber." "Stegg," the name for a
gander, is in Norse "Stegger." In the north nicknames
were general, and every man had his nickname,
particularly if there was aught remarkable in
his appearance or character. Some obtained such
names from their complexions, as the "Greys,"
"Whites," "Blacks," "Browns," "Blakes." Short
and dwarfish persons took the nicknames of
"Stutts," nowadays called "Stotts." Before
Christianity found its way among the natives, some
bore fanciful names, as may be instanced in
"Bjorn," a bear, now "Burns." Prefixes to such
fanciful names were also common, as in "Ashbjorn,"
the bear of the Osir or gods, in modern times spelt
"Ashburns"; and "Thorbjorn," the bear of Thor,
whence came "Thornber" and "Thorburn." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
name of "Mather" is Norse for Man, and as Norse
names are general, we may produce the following:
"Agur" from "Ager"; "Rigg" from "Rig";
"Grime" from "Grimr"; "Foster" from "Fostr";
"Harland" from "Arlant"; "Grundy" from
"Grunrd"; "Hawkes" from "Hawkr"; and
"Frost" from "Frosti," which are of frequent
occurrence in the old Norse Sagas.</p>

<p>In the Vale of the Lune the Danes have left
numerous traces. North of Lancaster is Halton,
properly "Haughton," named from the tumulus or
Danish "haugh," within the village. These are the
names of the "bojais" or farms belonging to
"byes," or residences of their greatmen. Near
Hornby we find such places at "Whaitber,"
"Stainderber," "Threaber," "Scalaber." Within
the manor of Hornby are "Santerfell," "Romsfell,"
"Litherell," or fell of the hillside. The name of
fell for mountain bespeaks Norse or Danish
influence.</p>

<p>The Raven was the national symbol of the
Danes. We have Ravenstonedale and Ravenshore,
and we also find the name in Rivington Pike, from
Raven-dun-pike. Pike is a common name for a
hill or spur standing away from the mountain range,
and is derived from the Picts. The derivation of
our common pronoun "same" is to be traced
through the old Norse "samt," "sama," and "som,"
and has been selected into our tongue from the
definite form "sama," the same. While we might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
expect to meet with this word, in the Lowland
Scotch, where the Norse influence was greater, the
people use the Anglo-Saxon "ilia" or "ylea,"
while in the general English, where the influence
of the Northmen was less, we have adopted the
Norse word "same," to the exclusion of the word
we might expect to consider as our own. Many a
good word do we owe to the Norsmen, whatever we
may think about their deeds.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Stone Crosses.</span></span></h2>

<p>The Parish Church of St. Peter, Bolton, was rebuilt
entirely by Mr. Peter Ormrod, whose surname
is Danish, and was consecrated on St. Peter's Day,
1871. Among the pre-Norman stones discovered
during the re-building were the broken head of a
supposed Irish cross, of circular type, probably of
the tenth century; part of the shaft of a cross bearing
a representation of Adam and Eve, with the apple
between their lips, and an upturned hand; and a
stone with carving of a nondescript monster. At
this period the Danes were the rulers of Ireland and
the Isle of Man, whose Bishops were men bearing
Danish names, and therefore we may assume that
this memorial was erected under their influence and
direction.</p>

<p>Some crosses, says Fosbrooke, in his Dictionary
of Antiquities, owe their origin to the early Christians
marking the Druid stones with crosses, in order to
change the worship without breaking the prejudice.
Some of the crosses presumed to be Runic rather
belong to the civilised Britons, were erected by many
of the Christian kings before a battle or a great
enterprise, with prayers and supplication for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
assistance of Almighty God. At a later period,
not probably earlier than the tenth century, a
Scandinavian influence shows itself, and to a very
appreciable extent modifies the ornamentation of
these monuments. It went even further, and
produced a representation of subjects, which,
however strange it may appear, are only explained
by a reference to the mythology of that part of
Europe. The grave covers, to which, on account of
their shape, the name of hog-backed stones has been
applied, appear to have occurred very rarely beyond
the counties of Cumberland, Durham, York, and
Lancaster, though some not quite of the ordinary
type have been found in Scotland, as, for instance,
at Govan, on the Clyde, near Glasgow. They
developed ultimately, through a transitional form,
into the coped stone with a representation of a
covering of tiles, the roof of man's last home, and
were a common grave cover of the twelfth century.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Stone Crosses.</span></h3>

<p>In pre-Reformation times there was scarcely a
village or hamlet in England which had not its
cross; many parishes, indeed, had more than one.
We know that at Liverpool there were the High
Cross, the White Cross, and St. Patrick's Cross.
While many of these crosses are of undoubted
Saxon origin, others bear distinct traces of Scandinavian
mythology.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">North Lancashire Relics.</span></h3>

<p>In the churchyard of Halton, near Lancaster, is
the shaft of an ancient cross. In 1635 the upper
part was removed by the rector, in order that the
portion remaining might be converted into a sundial.
On the east side are two panels, one showing two
human figures, in a sitting posture, engaged in
washing the feet of a seated figure; the other
showing two figures on either side of a tall cross.
This is the Christian side of a cross erected at a time
of transition. On the west side is a smith at work
with a pair of bellows. He is forging a large pair
of pincers, as he sits on a chair. Below the chair is
the bust of a man, or a coat of mail. Above him
is a sword of heavy type, also a second hammer, a
second pair of pincers, and a human body, with a
"figure of eight" knot, intertwined in a circle, in
place of a head, and an object at his feet representing
the head. The half-panel above has reference to
some event in the Sagas.</p>

<p>At Heysham, near Lancaster, also in the churchyard,
is an example of a hog-backed stone, a solid
mass six feet long and two feet thick, laid over some
ancient grave. On the stone is a stag, with broad
horns, and as it is not a reindeer it is said to be a
rude representation of an elk. The scene on this
side of the stone depicts an animal hunt. The
termination at each end is a rude quadruped on its
hind quarters. A fragment of a beautifully-sculptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
cross is still remaining, evidently part of a
cross which fitted into the socket of the stone.</p>

<p>In the churchyard of St. Mary's, Lancaster, was a
fine cross with a Runic inscription, meaning "Pray
for Cynebald, son of Cuthbert." This cross has been
removed to the British Museum.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Other Ancient Remains.</span></h3>

<p>At Whalley are three fine specimens of reputed
Saxon crosses. Tradition says they commemorate
the preaching of Paulinus in 625. Although they
have no remaining inscriptions, their obelisk form
and ornaments of fretwork were used in common by
the Norwegians, Saxons, and Danes.</p>

<p>In Winwick Churchyard is a great fragment of a
crosshead, consisting of the boss and two arms. On
the arms are a man with two buckets and a man
being held head downwards by two ferocious-looking
men, who have a saw beneath them, and are either
sawing him asunder or are preparing to saw off his
arms. This evidently relates to Oswald, for he was
dismembered by order of Pemba, and the buckets
might refer to the miracle-working well which sprang
up where his body fell.</p>

<p>At Upton, Birkenhead, is a sculptured stone
bearing a Runic inscription. Dr. Browne takes the
inscription to mean: "The people raised a
memorial: Pray for Aethelmund."</p>

<p>At West Kirby is a nearly complete example of a
hog-backed stone. The lower part is covered on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
both sides by rough interlacing bands, and the
middle and upper part with scales, the top being
ornamented with a row of oblong rings on each side,
with a band running through each row of rings.
The work at the top, which looks like a row of
buckles, is very unusual. The stone, which is of
harder material than any stone in the neighbourhood,
must have been brought from a distance, and in the
memorial of some important person, probably
Thurstan, as we find the name Thurstaston in the
locality. There is also at West Kirby a flat slab
on the face of which a cross is sculptured. This is
very unusual in England, though not rare in Scotland
and Ireland.</p>

<p>At Hilbree, the island off West Kirby, there is a
cross of like character.</p>

<p>Principal Rhys says that in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries the Norsemen were in the habit of largely
recruiting their fleet in Shetland and the Orkneys,
not merely with thrales, but with men of a higher
position. They infused thus a certain amount of
Pictish blood into the island. The "Shetland bind"&mdash;Oghams
distributed over the island, in such places
as Braddan, Turby, Michael, Onchan, and Bride.
The Norwegian language, says Mr. C. Roeder, was
spoken practically from 890&ndash;1270; it was introduced
by the Shetland and Orkney men, and from
Norway, with which connection was kept, as shown
by the grammatical structure of the Runic stones in
the island, which falls between 1170 and 1230. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
was the only language of the rulers, and used at
"Thing" and Hall, resembling in this old Norman
barons and their counts in King William the
Conqueror's time.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Norsemen lives in the legal
constitution of the Government, an inheritance that
produced a free Parliament, and particularly in its
place-names. The sea fringe, with its hundreds of
Norse rocks, creeks, and forelands, and caves, have
left imperishable evidence of the mighty old seafarers,
the track they took, and the commingling and
fusion they underwent in blood and speech, and
their voyages from the Shetlands and Western Isles.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some Human Remains.</span></h3>

<p>Claughton-on-Brock, near Preston, is named
Clactune in Domesday Book. The Danes have
also left relics of their presence and influence as
they have done all over the Fylde district. The
late Monsignor Gradwell, a great student of local
nomenclature and a Lancashire historian of considerable
repute, wrote: "In Claughton the Roman
road crosses the Fleet, a small brook in the Sixacre.
About seventy years ago a barrow was found on the
west of the New Lane, about half a mile south of
the street. In it were found an earthenware urn
containing the burnt remains of a human body, with
some delicately wrought silver brooches, some beads
and arms, a dagger and a sword. The brooch of
fretwork was precisely similar to many ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Danish brooches still preserved in the Copenhagen
Museum, and this proves that the Claughton deposit
was also Danish. That the Danes were strong in
Claughton and in the neighbourhood is proved by
the many Danish names. Thus, we have Dandy
Birk, or Danes Hill; Stirzacre, and Barnacre,
respectively Stirs land and Biorn's land. The
Danish relics were carefully deposited at Claughton
Hall by the finder, Mr. Thomas Fitzherbert
Brockholes."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Halton Cross.</span></h3>

<p>Now what is to be said about the subjects carved
on these crosses and about the date of the work?
One of the subjects is most remarkable, and gives
a special interest to this cross; for here on the west
face and north we have the story of Sigurd Fafnir's
bane; here is his sword and the forging of it, his
horse Grani, which bore away the treasure; the
roasting of the dragon's heart; the listening to the
voice of the birds, and the killing of Regin the smith.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="ip_125" src="images/i_151.jpg" width="500" height="458" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">Halton Cross.</div></div>

<p>The story so far as it relates to our subject is
this: We all know that the love of money is the root
of all evil. Now there were two brothers, Fafnir
and Regin. Fafnir held all the wealth, and became
a huge monster dragon, keeping watch over his
underground treasure-house. Regin, his brother,
had all skill in smith's work, but no courage. He
it was who forged the sword wherewith the hero
Sigurd went forth to kill the dragon and take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
treasure. This he did with the help of his wonderful
horse Grani, who, when the heavy boxes of treasure
were placed on his back, would not move until his
master had mounted, but then went off merrily
enough. This story, Anglicised and Christianised,
is the story of our English patron saint St. George,
the horse rider and the dragon slayer. Here is the
story written in stone.</p>

<p>We know the ancient belief that the strength of
every enemy slain passes into the body of the
conqueror.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Illustration of Hog-back Stone.</span></h3>

<p>The stone is perhaps more than a thousand years
old, and has been a good deal knocked about. It
was once the tomb of a great Christian Briton or
Englishman, before the Norman Conquest; and you
may still see four other "hog-backed Saxon"
uncarved tombstones in Lowther Churchyard,
marking the graves of the noble of that day. When
a stone church was built, our sculptured shrine was
built into the walls of the church, and some of the
mortar still sticks to the red sandstone. When this
old church was pulled down to give place to a new
one this same stone, covered with lime and unsightly,
was left lying about. You will see something twisted
and coiled along the bottom of each drawing beneath
the figures, and you will see some strange designs
(they are sacred symbols used long ago) on either
side of one of the heads in the lower picture; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
what will strike you most will be the long curls of
hair, and the hands pressed to the breast or folded
and pressed together as if in prayer; and, above all,
you will notice that all these people seem to be
asleep; their eyes are closed and their hands folded
or pressed to their breast, and they all look as if
they were either asleep or praying, or very peaceful
and at perfect rest. These people are not dead;
look at their faces and mark generally the attitudes
of repose.</p>

<p>Now let us find something worth remembering
about all this.</p>

<p>The tombstone is made like a little house to
represent the home of the dead. But at the time I
am speaking of the people believed that only those
who died bravely fighting would have a life of
happiness afterwards; other people who were not
wicked people at all&mdash;but all who died of sickness
or old age&mdash;went to the cold, dark world ruled over
by a goddess called "Hel," who was the daughter
of the Evil one. "Such is the origin of our word
Hell, the name of a goddess applied to a locality.
Her domains were very great and her yard walls
very high. Hunger is her dish, starvation her knife,
care is her bed, a beetling cliff is the threshold of her
hall, which is hung with grief." All, except the
warriors who died fighting, however good, went to
her domain. It might be thought that to be with
such a goddess after death was bad enough, but
there was a worse place. For the wicked another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
place was prepared, a great hall and a bad one; its
doors looked northward. It was altogether wrought
of adders' backs wattled together, and the heads of
the adder all turned inwards, and spit venom, so that
rivers of venom ran along the hall, and in those
rivers the wicked people must wade for ever.</p>

<p>The Christian wished to show that this terrible
idea of man's future state was to fire away to something
better through the Lord of Life, our Lord
Jesus Christ, and so they set up crosses and carried
triquetra, the sign of the ever blessed Trinity,
on their sculptured tombs to teach the people to
believe no longer in gods and goddesses of darkness,
but to look to one God, the Father, Son and Holy
Spirit, to drive away all evil spirits from their hearts,
and to give them a quiet time and a perfect end.
Was there any wonder that years afterwards, when
the bright light shone forth from the Cross to
disperse the dark clouds of paganism, that men said
that holy men, such as Patrick, Kentigern and
Cuthbert had driven all poisonous snakes out of the
land? The twisted and coiling thing beneath the
figures is no doubt the old serpent. The Cross of
Christ and the ash tree Yggdrasil of the northern
tribes bore a like meaning at a certain time to the
mixed peoples on this coast. (W.&nbsp;S. Collingwood.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Anglo-Danish Monuments.</span></h3>

<p>The great variety of ornament found in the
North Riding Monuments shows that in four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
centuries many influences were brought to bear
upon the sculptors' art, and much curious development
went on, of which we may in the future
understand the cause.</p>

<p>Our early sculptors, like the early painters, were
men trying hard to express their ideals, which we
have to understand before we can appreciate their
work. The Anglian people included writers and
thinkers like Bede and Alcuin, and that their two
centuries of independence in the country of which
the North Riding was the centre and heart, were
two centuries of a civilization which ranked high in
the world of that age. The Danish invasion, so
lamentable in its earlier years, brought fresh blood
and new energies in its train, and up to the Norman
Conquest this part of England was rich and
flourishing.</p>

<p>In writing the history of its art, part of the
material will be found in these monuments.</p>

<p>The material of which these sculptures are made
is usually of local stone. They were carved on the
spot and not imported ready made.</p>

<p>In the progress of Anglian art we have the
development which began with an impulse coming
from the north, and ending with influence coming
from the south.</p>

<p>The monuments were possibly executed by
Anglian sculptors under the control of Danish
Conquerors. Even under the early heathen rule
of the Danes, Christians worked and lived, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
each succeeding colony of Danes became Christianised,
they required gravestones, and Churches to be
carved for them.</p>

<p>Following a generation of transition, at the end
of the ninth century, monuments are found displaying
Danish taste. The close connection of the
York kingdom with Dublin, provides a reason for
the Irish influence. Abundant evidence is found in
the chain pattern, and ring patterns, the dragons,
and wheelheads, which are hacked and not finished
into a rounded surface by chiselling.</p>

<p>The Brompton hogbacks are among the finest
works of this period.</p>

<p>The Stainton bear, and the Wycliffe bear, are also
of this period.</p>

<p>The Pickhill hogback has an Irish-Scandavian
dragon, and other dragons are to be seen at Gilling,
Crathorne, Easington, Levisham, Sinnington, and
Pickering.</p>

<p>New influences came from the Midlands into
Yorkshire, after the fall of the Dublin-York
kingdom, about the year 950. One instance of
this advance in the sculptor's art is to be seen in
the round shaft, trimmed square above, at Gilling,
Stanwick, and Middleton, which came from Mercia,
and passed on into Cumberland, where it is to be
found at Penrith and Gosforth. These latter have
Edda subjects and appear to be late tenth century.</p>

<p>Gilling has a curious device, which may possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
be the völund wing wheel, and völund appears on
the Leeds cross, and also at Neston in Cheshire.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian chain pattern, frequent on the
<i>stones</i> of the North Riding, and in Cumberland, is
entirely absent in manuscripts. There must have
been books at Lastingham, Hackness, Gilling, and
other great monasteries, but the stone-carvers did
not copy them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="ip_131" src="images/i_159.jpg" width="600" height="463" alt="" /><br /></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="ip_131a" src="images/i_159a.jpg" width="600" height="354" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">Base and Side of the Ormside Cup.</div></div>

<p>The Ormside cup, on the other hand, has close
analogies with the two important monuments at
Croft and Northallerton, which seem to be the
leading examples of the finest style, from which all
the rest evolve, not without influence from abroad
at successive periods. It is to relief work rather
than to manuscripts that we must look for the
inspiration of the sculptors.</p>

<p>In these monuments linked together we can trace
the continuation of the Viking age style during the
later half of the tenth century and the early part of
the eleventh centuries. The stone carver's art was
reviving, stones were becoming more massive, which
means that they were more skilfully quarried, the
cutting is more close and varied, and on its terms
the design is more decorative and artistic, though
still preserving its northern character among impulses
and influences from the south. But there is
no room here for the Bewcastle cross or the
Hovingham stone. We have an example of this
period's attempt to imitate.</p>

<p>It is probable that the stone carving was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
traditional business, began by St. Wilfrid's, and
Benedict Bishop's imported masons, and carried on
in a more or less independent development as it
is to-day.</p>

<p>With the Danish invasion began a period of new
influences which were not shaken off until after the
Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>The interlaced work was abandoned in the tenth
century by southern sculptors, remained the national
art of the north. The Manx, Irish, and Scotch kept
it long after the eleventh century, and so did the
Scandinavians.</p>

<p>The Bewcastle cross in the Gigurd shaft of the
cross at Halton in Lancashire, and if this development
has been rightly described the Halton shaft
is easily understood.</p>

<p>In the period covered by the eleventh century
dials inscribed with Anglo-Danish names date themselves.
Interlacing undergoes new development,
becoming more open and angular, until we get right
lined plaits like Wensley, it is better cut, as the
later part of the century introduces the masons who
rebuilt the churches and began the abbeys. No
longer was the work hacked but clean chiselled, and
intermingled with new grotesques; we find it at
Hackness, in the impost, and in the fonts at Alne
and Bowes, where we are already past the era of the
Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>Recumbent monuments were grave-slabs, which
may have been coffin lids, such as must have fitted
the Saxon rock graves at Heysham, Lancashire,
while other forms may have simply marked the
place under which a burial was made. They are
found with Anglian lettering at Wensley, another
has been removed from Yarm, and those of the
Durham district are well known.</p>

<p>The two stones at Wensley may have been
recumbent, like the Melsonby stones. The Spennithorne
slab bears crosses of the earlier Northumbrian
type, seen again in the West Wilton slab. At
Crathorne are two slabs, with "Maltese" crosses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
apparently late, all the preceding being of the fine
style.</p>

<h2><a name="Runes" id="Runes">Runes</a></h2>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">Runes.</span></h2>

<p>Before dealing with the Norse and Danish
antiquities of Lancashire, of which we have some
remains in the form of sculptured stones, and
ancient crosses, it would be profitable to inquire
into the origin and development of that mysterious
form of letters known as Runes or Runic. How
many of the thousands who annually visit the Isle
of Man are aware that the island contains a veritable
museum of Runic historical remains? A brief
survey of these inscriptions, which have yielded
definite results, having been deciphered for us by
eminent scholars, will help us to understand the
nature of those to be found in our own county.</p>

<p>We are told by Dr. Wägner that Runes were
mysterious signs. The word Rune is derived from
rûna, a secret. The form of the writing would
appear to be copied from the alphabet of the
Phoenicians. The Runes were looked upon, for
many reasons, as full of mystery and supernatural
power. In the fourth century Ulphilas made a
new alphabet for the Goths by uniting the form of
the Greek letters to the Runic alphabet, consisting
of twenty-five letters, which was nearly related to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
that of the Anglo-Saxons. The Runes gradually
died out as Christianity spread, and the Roman
alphabet was introduced in the place of the old
Germanic letters. The Runes appear to have
served less as a mode of writing than as a help to
memory, and were principally used to note down a
train of thought, to preserve wise sayings and
prophecies, and the remembrance of particular
deeds and memorable occurrences.</p>

<p>Tacitus informs us that it was the custom to cut
beech twigs into small pieces, and then throw them
on a cloth, which had been previously spread out
for the purpose, and afterwards to read future
events by means of the signs accidentally formed
by the bits of wood as they lay in the cloth.</p>

<p>In his catalogue of Runic inscriptions found on
Manx crosses, Kermode says that "of the sculptors'
names which appear all are Norse. Out of a total
of forty-four names, to whom these crosses were
erected, thirty-two are those of men, eight of women,
and four are nicknames. Of men, nineteen names
are Norse, nine Celtic, three doubtful, and one
Pictish." This proves the predominance of Norse
and Danish chiefs to whom these monuments were
erected. Runes are simply the characters in which
these inscriptions are carved, and have nothing to
do with the language, which in the Manx inscriptions
is Scandinavian of the 12th Century.</p>

<p>To speak of a stone which bears an inscription
in Runes as a Runic stone is as though we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
call a modern tombstone a Roman stone because
the inscription is carved in Roman capitals. Canon
Taylor traces the origin of Runes to a Greek source,
namely, the Thracian or second Ionian alphabet,
which, through the intercourse of the Greek colonists
at the mouth of the Danube with the Goths south
of the Baltic, was introduced in a modified form
into Northern Europe, and had become established
as a Runic "Futhork" as early as the Christian
era. The main stages of development are classified
by Canon Taylor as the Gothic, the Anglican, and
the Scandinavian.</p>

<p>The Rune consists of a stem with the twigs or
letters falling from left or right. This is the most
common form to be found, allowing for difference
of workmanship, of material, and space. The
progress in the development of the Rune may be
observed from the most simple plait or twist, to the
most complex and beautiful geometric, and to the
zoomorphic. The latter has the striking features
of birds and beasts of the chase, and also of men,
many being realistic; and except the latter are well
drawn. The forms of the men are sometimes found
with heads of birds or wings. In addition to
decorative work we find on three of the cross slabs
illustrations from the old Norse sagas. On a large
cross at Braddan is a representation of Daniel in
the lion's den; and at Bride, on a slab, is a mediæval
carving of the fall of Adam, in which the serpent
is absent. Both Pagan and Christian emblems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
derive their ornamentation from the same source,
"basket work."</p>

<p>Long after the introduction of Christianity we
find the Pagan symbols mixed up in strange devices
on the same stones, which were erected as Christian
monuments. In the "Lady of the Lake," Sir
Walter Scott gives an account of the famous fiery
cross formed of twigs.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The grisly priest, with murmuring prayer,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The cross, thus formed, he held on high,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Basketmaking is the parent of all modern textile
art, and no other industry is so independent of
tools. It is the humble parent of the modern
production of the loom, and the most elaborate cloth
is but the development of the simple wattle work of
rude savages. Plaiting rushes is still the earliest
amusement of children, the patterns of which are
sometimes identical with the designs engraved by
our earliest ancestors on their sculptured stones.
Interlaced ornament is to be met with on ancient
stones and crosses all over our islands. Ancient
pottery also shows that the earliest form of
ornament was taken from basket designs.</p>

<p>The Lough Derg pilgrim sought a cross made
of interwoven twigs, standing upon a heap of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
stones, at the east end of an old church. This was
known as St. Patrick's Altar. This is recorded by
a certain Lord Dillon in 1630, who visited the island
known as St. Patrick's Purgatory on the Lough
Derg, in Ireland. The wicker cross retained its
grasp upon the superstitious feelings of the people
after the suppression at the Reformation. He says
of this miserable little islet that the tenant paid a
yearly rent of £300, derived from a small toll of
sixpence charged at the ferry. This was probably
the last of the innumerable crosses of the same
wicker and twigs. (Lieut.-Col. French, Bolton.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Runic Almanacs.</span></h3>

<p>When the northern nations were converted to
Christianity the old Pagan Festivals were changed
to Christian holidays, and the old Pagan divinities
were replaced by Christian Saints. The faith
placed in the early deities was transferred to the
latter. As certain deities had formerly been supposed
to exercise influence over the weather and the
crops; so the days dedicated to them, were now
dedicated to certain Saints.</p>

<p>The days thus dedicated were called Mark-days,
and as it may be supposed it became the office of
the Clergy to keep account of the time and to
calculate when the various holidays would occur.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that many Christian feasts are
what are called movable, that is, are not fixed to a
certain date but depend on Easter, the reckoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
was more difficult for the laity than it had been in
Pagan times.</p>

<p>In those days the fixed holidays could be easily
remembered. An ordinary man without knowing
how to read or write could keep a list of them by
cutting marks or notches on strips of wood.</p>

<p>The successors of these are called Messe, and
Prim Staves. The Messe staves are the more
simple&mdash;<i>Messe-daeg</i> means Mass day, and the
stave only denoted such days. The Prim stave
contained besides the marks for Sundays and the
moon's changes. Hence their name from Prima-Luna,
or first full moon after the equinox. The
Messe-daeg staves are frequently met with. They
consist generally of flat pieces of wood about a yard
or an ell long, two inches wide, and half an inch
thick, and have frequently a handle, giving them the
appearance of a wooden sword. The flat side is
divided into two unequal portions by a line running
lengthways. In the narrow part, the days are
notched at equal distances, half the year on each
side, or 182 marks on one side and 183 on the other.
In the wider space and connected with the days are
the signs for those which are to be particularly
observed: on the edges the weeks are indicated.
The marks for the days do not run from January
to July and from July to December, but on the
winter side (Vetr-leid) from October 14 to April 13,
and in the summer side (Somar-leid) from April 14
to October 13. The signs partly refer to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
weather, partly to husbandry, and partly the legends
of the Saints. Seldom are two staves formed
exactly alike. Not only do the signs vary but the
days themselves. Nor are they always flat, but
sometimes square, <i>i.e.</i>, with four equal sides: when
of the latter shape they are called clogs, or clog
almanacs.</p>

<p>They are called Cloggs, <i>i.e.</i>, Logg, Almanacks =
Al-mon-aght, viz., the regard or observation of all
the Moons, because by means of these squared
sticks, says Verstegan, they could certainly tell
when the new Moons, full Moons, or other changes
should happen, and consequently Easter and the
other movable feasts. They are called by the
Danes Rim-stocks, not only because the Dominical
letters were anciently expressed on them in Runic
characters, but also because the word Rimur
anciently signified a Calendar. By the Norwegians
with whom they are still in use, they are called
Prim-staves, and for this reason, the principal and
most useful thing inscribed on them being the prime
or golden number, whence the changes of the moon
are understood, and also as they were used as
walking sticks, they were most properly called
Prim-staves.</p>

<p>The origin of these Runic or Clog-calendars was
Danish (vide Mr. J.&nbsp;W. Bradley, M.A., Salt Library,
Stafford). They were unknown in the South,
and only known by certain gentry in the North.
They are quite unknown in Ireland and Scotland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
and are only known from the few examples preserved
in the Museums.</p>

<p>Owing to the changes of custom in modern times
these wooden perpetual almanacs have become
quite superseded by the printed annuals.</p>

<p>The inscriptions read proceeding from the right
hand side of the notches, are marks or symbols of
the festivals expressed in a kind of hieroglyphic
manner, pointing out the characteristics of the
Saints, against whose festivals they are placed,
others the manner of their Martyrdom; others some
remarkable fact in their lives; or to the work or
sport of the time when the feasts were kept.</p>

<p>Thus on January 13 the Feast of St. Hiliary is
denoted by a Cross or Crozier, the badge of a
Bishop.</p>

simple angular indentations <img class="r" src="images/i_173a.png" alt="" /> but occasionally
with other marks to denote the date of certain
special Festivals.</p>

<p>The more ancient almanac called Runic Primitare,
so named from the Prima-luna or new moon which
gave the appellation of Prime to the Lunar or
Golden Number, so called because the Number was
marked in gold on the stave. The Rim Stocks of
Denmark so called from Rim, a calendar and stock
a staff. The marks called Runic characters were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
supposed to have magical powers and so were
regarded with dread by the Christians and were
often destroyed by the priests and converts to
Christianity.</p>

<p>They were derived from rude imitations of the
Greek letters. Two of these staves now in the
Museum at Copenhagen are 4 feet 8½ inches and
3 feet 8 inches long respectively. They are hand
carved and not in any sense made by machinery.
This accounts from them being rarely alike, and
often very different from one another.</p>

<p>The Sun in his annual career returns to the same
point in the Zodiac in 365 days, 6 hours, nearly.
The Moon who is really the month maker, as the
Sun is the year maker, does 12 of her monthly
revolutions in 354 days. So that a lunar year is
11 days shorter than the solar, supposing both to
start from the same date. The actual lunar month
contains about 29½ days. Therefore in order to
balance the two reckonings, it was agreed at a
convention of Scientist Christians of Alexandria in
the year <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 323, two years previous to the Council
of Nice, to make the distances between the new
moon alternately 29 and 30 days, and to place the
golden number accordingly. Now these Egyptian
scholars observed that the new moon nearest the
vernal Equinox in 323 was on the 27th day of the
Egyptian month Phauranoth, corresponding with
our 23rd of March, so the cycle was commenced on
this day. This is the reason why the golden number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
1 is placed against it, 29 days from this brought
them to the 21st April, and 30 days from this to the
21st May, and so on through the year.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Runic Calendar.</span></h3>

<p>The explanatory engraving of the Calendar
shows the year begins on the 23rd December.
That this date is correctly given for the first day
of the year is proved by the agreement between
the Saints days and the days of the month on which
they fall and the Christian Sunday Letters.</p>

<p>In thus beginning the year this Calendar exhibits
a rare peculiarity. No other Runic Calendar
begins the year in the same manner, while numbers
could be shown which begin the year at Yuletide,
commencing on the 25th December.</p>

<p>Of the two modes of beginning it there is no
question that the one here exhibited is the genuine
heathen while the other is genuine Christian. It is
worth noticing that as Winter takes precedence of
Summer in the sense of a year: so night takes
precedence of day generally in the sense of a civil
day of 24 hours in old Icelandic writers, a manner
of speech which to this day is far from having gone
out of use.</p>

<p>Considering the heathen tradition preserved in
this Calendar in the number of days given to the
year and in the date given to the commencement of
the year, in which it stands unique, in the fact that
the interval between 1230 and 1300, <i>i.e.</i>, out of 160<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
years rich in famous local and famous general
Saints, not one should be recorded here: that Saints
of universal adoration in the Catholic Church, such
as St. Thomas of Canterbury, St. Benedict, and
others, should not have a place here: we cannot
escape referring it to an age when it may be fairly
supposed that these heathen traditions were still
believed in by at least a considerable number of the
community.</p>

<p>Anterior to 1230 it cannot be, long posterior to
that date it can scarcely be. That it must be a
layman's Calendar, is shown because it exhibits no
golden numbers, and gives consequently no clue to
the Paschal cycle or movable feasts. It is a very
valuable piece of antiquity and ought to be well
taken care of.</p>

<p>On 2nd February were anciently observed all
over the Pagan north certain rites connected with
the worship of fire. In some places the toast or
bumper of the fire was drunk by the whole family
kneeling round the fire, who at the same time offered
grain or beer to the flames on the hearth. This was
the so-called Eldborgs-skäl, the toast of fire salvage,
a toast which was meant to avert disaster by fire for
the coming year.</p>

<p>Fire and Sun worship mingled together, no doubt
in observance of this feast: for where it was most
religiously observed amongst the Swedes it was
called Freysblôt and was a great event. In early
Christian times only wax candles which had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
the blessing of the priest, were burnt in the houses
of the people, in the evening. Hence Candlemas,&mdash;see
illustration in Stephens' Scandinavian Monuments.
From a remarkable treatise by Eirikr Magnusson,
M.A., on a Runic Calendar found in Lapland in
1866, bearing English Runes. (Cambridge Antiq.
Soc. Communications, Vol. X., No. 1, 1877.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">This English (?) or Norwegian Runic Calendar
is dated about A.D. 1000&ndash;1100.</span></h3>

<p>What distinguishes this piece is that seemingly
from its great age and its having been <i>made in
England</i>, it has preserved in the outer or lower lines
several of <i>the olden Runes</i>. These are the "Notae
Distortae" spoken of by Worm. Some of these
as we can plainly see are provincial <i>English</i> varieties
of the old northern Runes.</p>

<p>The Calendar before us is of bone, made from
the jaw-bone of the porpoise. We know nothing
of its history. Worm says, "Probably to this class
must be assigned the peculiar Calendar carved on
a concave bone, part of the jaw-bone of some large
fish." Although it shows three rows of marks the
signs of Festivals, the Solar Cycle and the Lunar
Cycle, this last is here very imperfect and has even
some distorted marks as we see in the engraving.</p>

<p>Each side, the concave as well as the convex,
bears near the edge its girdling three rows of marks,
so that every series comprehends a quarter of a year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
beginning with the day of Saint Calixtus. As
Worm has only given one side of this curious Rune-blade,
we cannot know the peculiarities of the other
half, which contained the Solar Cycle, and the three
sign lines for two quarters.</p>

<p>On the side given, the Runes on the right hand
are reversed and read from top to bottom; those on
the left hand are not retrograde. It may often have
been carried on the person, being only 18 inches
long. The clog calendars range in length from
3 to 4 feet, to as many inches.</p>

<p>Whenever we light upon any kind of <i>Runic</i>
pieces, we are at once confined <i>to the north</i>,
Scandinavia and England. Though so numerous
in the Northern lands, no Runic Calendar has ever
yet been found in any Saxon or German province,
except a couple bought or brought by modern
travellers, as curiosities from Scandinavia.</p>

<p>Stephens says this whole class of Antiquities has
never yet been properly treated. It offers work for
one man's labours during a long time and many
journeys. It would produce a rich harvest as to the
signs and symbols, and Runes as modified by local
use and clannish custom. All the symbol marks
should be treated in parallel groups. The various
and often peculiar Runes should be carefully
collected and elucidated. All this is well worthy
of a competent Rune-Smith, Computist, and
Ecclesiologist. On many of the <i>old</i> Runic
Calendars, especially in Sweden, we find a "<i>lake</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
or game long famous all over Europe, but now
mostly known to children, called "the Lake" or
game of Saint Peter. This is an ingenious way of
so placing 30 persons, that we may save one half
from death or imprisonment, by taking out each
ninth man as a victim, till only one half the original
number is left. These 15 are thus all rescued. Of
course the man thus taken must not be counted a
second time.</p>

<p>Formerly the favoured 15 were called Christians
and the other Jews. Carving this in one line, we
get the marks so often found on Rune-clogs:</p>

<p class="center">
xxxx|||||xx|xxx|x||xx|||x||xx|<br />
</p>

<p>The story about it is this: Saint Peter is said to have
been at sea in a ship in which were 30 persons, the
one half Christians and the other half Jews. But
a storm arose so furious that the vessel had to be
lightened, and it was resolved to throw overboard
half the crew. Saint Peter then ranged them in the
order we see, every ninth man was taken out. The
crosses betoken the Christians and the strokes the
Jews. In this way all the Jews were cast into the
deep while all the Christians remained. Herewith
the old were wont to amuse themselves.</p>

<p><i>Folk-lore of children in rhyme and ritual.</i> The
child is surrounded by an ancient circle of ritualism
and custom. Visitors to see the infant must take
it a threefold gift. In some districts in Yorkshire
the conditions are a little tea, sugar, and oven-cake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Another Yorkshire practice is to take an egg, some
salt, and a piece of silver. The child must not be
brought downstairs to see the visitor, for to bring it
downstairs would be to give it a start in life in the
wrong direction. The form of this idea is to be
found in certain (Japanese) customs. The child's
finger-nails must not be cut with scissors, for iron
had such close association with witchcraft. The
nails must be bitten off with the teeth. This
practice survives in some adults, much to the disgust
of their friends.</p>

<p>Of children's games, that known as "Hopscotch"
was originally a religious rite practised at
funerals. It was symbolical of the passage of the
soul from the body to heaven or the other place to
which the ancients gave various names. The
pattern which is drawn for the purpose of this game
has been found on the floor of the Roman Forum.</p>

<p>Another game called "Cat's Cradle" was played
by the North American Indians, and has recently
found on an island north of Australia. When
children could not play on account of the rain they
recited a little rhyme which is still known to-day by
the people of Austria and in the wilds of Asia.
The game of "Ring o' Roses" is the survival of an
old incantation addressed to the Corn Spirit. When
the wind rippled across the cornfield the ancient
harvesters thought the corn god was passing by,
and would recite the old rhyme, closing with the
words, "Hark the cry! hark the cry! all fall down!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Sometimes the corn spirit was supposed to become
incarnated in the form of a cow, hence the line in
the nursery jingle, "Boy Blue! the cow's in the
corn." When the boy donned his first pair of
breeches he must pass through a ritual. He must
be nipped. The significance of the nip was a test
to see whether the boy in the new breeches was the
same boy, or whether he had been changed by the
fairies or evil spirits. This idea of a change by
evil spirits might seem far-fetched, but so recently
as 1898, in the records of the Irish courts there was
a case in which an Irishman was tried for accusing
his wife of not being the same person as when he
married her, and of the woman being branded in
consequence. Superstitions as to the cure of certain
childish complaints survive in the cure for whooping
cough, to take the sufferer "over t' watter." That
is the only medicinal use of the river Aire, near
Leeds.</p>

<p>At the time of the Conquest the population in
some of the largest and most important cities is said
to have been almost exclusively of Scandinavian
extraction.</p>

<p>In the north the Norwegian saint, "St. Olave,"
has been zealously commemorated in both towns and
country. This proves that churches were built and
Christian worship performed during the Danish
dominion, and that these Northmen continued to
reside here in great numbers after the Danish
ascendancy ended.</p>

<p>In the city of Chester there is a church and parish
which still bears the name of St. Olave, and by the
church runs a street called St. Olave's Lane. This
is opposite the old castle and close to the river Dee.
In the north-west part of York there is a St. Olave's
Church, said to be the remains of a monastery
founded by the powerful Danish Earl Sieward, who
was himself buried there in the year 1058. Long
before the Norman Conquest, the Danes and Northmen
preponderated in many of the towns of the
North of England, which they fortified, and there
erected churches dedicated to their own sainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
kings and warriors. Olave is derived from "Olaf
the White," who was a famous Norse Viking. He
subdued Dublin about the middle of the ninth
century, and made himself king of the city and
district. From this time Ireland and the Isle of
Man were ruled by Norwegian kings for over three
centuries.</p>

<p>It may therefore be inferred, by a natural process
of deductive reasoning, that during this period the
Danes were founding their settlements in Lancashire.
Although we have no distinct traces of
buildings erected by them, the names given by them
to many places still survive. In these compound
names the word "kirk" is often met with. This
must establish the fact that the Danes erected many
other churches besides St. Olave's at Chester and
York. From Chester and West Kirby, in the
Wirral district, to Furness, in the North, we have
abundant evidence in the name of Kirk, and its
compound forms, that many Christian churches were
erected. At Kirkdale, Ormskirk, Kirkham, Kirkby
Lonsdale, Kirby Moorside, and Kirkby Stephen
Norman churches have superseded Danish buildings.
Kendal was known formerly as Kirkby-in-Kendal,
or the "Church-town in the valley of Kent." And
further memorials here survive in the names of
streets, such as Stramongate, Gillingate, Highgate,
and Strickland-gate.</p>

<p>The name Furness is distinctly Scandinavian,
from "Fur" and "Ness," or Far promontory. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
abbot of Furness was intimate with the Danish
rulers of Manxland, for he got a portion of land
there in 1134 to build himself a palace. He was
followed by the Prior of Whithorn and St. Bede.
In 1246 the monks of Furness obtained all kinds of
mines in Man, and some land near St. Trinian's.
By the industry and ability of these monks Furness
became one of the wealthiest abbeys in England,
and thus were laid the foundations of one of the
greatest industries in Lancashire, viz., the smelting
of iron ore.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Literature.</span></span></h2>

<p>During that period when the Danes were making
their conquests and settlements in the North of
England, art and literature did not hold any high
position in Europe. The fall of the Roman Empire
gave a shock to the pursuits of learning which had
not recovered when Christian art was in its infancy.
The Northmen early distinguished themselves in
the art of shipbuilding, and also in the manufacture
of ornaments, domestic utensils, and weapons.
This taste had arisen from the imitation of the
Roman and Arabesque articles of commerce which
they brought up into the North. Some Scandinavian
antiquities have been discovered belonging to the
period called "the age of bronze," and also the later
heathen times, known as "the iron age." The
Sagas record that the carving of images was skilfully
practised in the north, and the English
Chronicles provide records of richly carved figures
on the bows of Danish and Norse vessels. The
Normans from Denmark who settled in Normandy
were first converted to Christianity, and early displayed
the desire to erect splendid buildings,
especially churches and monasteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Long before the Norman Conquest, the Danes
devoted themselves to peaceful occupations. Several
of the many churches and convents were erected by
Danish princes and chiefs, in the northern parts of
England, which have now been re-built, or disappeared;
but their names survive to distinguish their
origin. It has been said that these early buildings
were composed of wood. This is proved from the
work recently issued by Mr. J. Francis Bumpus, in
his "Cathedrals of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark."
The touching life story of the martyred Saint Olaf
is there told. A wooden chapel was built over his
grave about the year 1047. This became the centre
of the national religion, and the sanctuary of the
national freedom and independence. Trondhjem,
says Mr. Bumpus, is the eloquent expression in
stone of Norway's devotion to the beloved St. Olaf.
Despoiled of much of its ornamentation by
Protestant zeal, it retains in the octagon of its noble
choir a true architectural gem, equal in delicate
beauty to the Angel Choir of Lincoln.</p>

<p>The phrase "skryke of day" is common to South
Lancashire, and is the same as the old English
"at day pype," or "peep of day." "There is a
great intimacy," says Dr. Grimm, "between our
ideas of light and sound, of colour and music, and
hence we are able to comprehend that rustling, and
that noise, which is ascribed to the rising and setting
Sun." Thomas Kingo, a Danish poet of the seventeenth
century, and probably others of his countrymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
make the rising of the Sun to pipe (pfeifen),
that is to utter a piercing sound.</p>

<p>Tacitus had long before recorded the Swedish
superstition, that the rising Sun made a noise. The
form in which our skryke of day has come down to
us is Scandinavian. Grimm says, "Still more
express are the passages which connect the break
of day, and blush of the morning, with ideas of
commotion and rustling." Goethe has in "Faust"
borrowed from the Pythagorean and Platonic
doctrine of the harmony of the spheres, and
illustrated Grimm's proposition of the union of our
ideas of light and sound by describing the course
of the Sun in its effulgence as a march of thunder.
Jonson regarded noise as an essential quality of the
heavenly <span class="locked">bodies&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="i2">And all the world turned ears."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The noise of daybreak may be gathered from the
fracture of metal, and applied to the severance of
darkness and light, may well have sound attributed
to it. The old meaning of "peep (or pype) of day"
was the joyful cry which accompanied the birth of
light. "Peep," as sound is most ancient, and a
"nest of peepers," that is, of young birds, is now
almost obsolete English. Milton, in "Paradise
Lost," shows the setting Sun to make a noise from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
its heated chariot axles being quenched in the
Atlantic. Once, at Creation, the morning stars sang
for joy; but afterwards moved in expressive silence.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ballads and War Songs.</span></h3>

<p>As a consequence of the Danish and Norman
conquests, a peculiar composition arose called
Anglo-Danish and Anglo-Norman. These legends
and war songs were produced by the Danish wars,
and were the expressions of an adventurous and
knightly spirit, which became prevalent in England.
The most celebrated of them were the romances of
"Beowulf," "Havelock, the Dane," and "Guy,
Earl of Warwick." In the older romances of
Scandinavian songs and sages, combats against
dragons, serpents, and plagues are celebrated; in
later romances of the age of chivalry, warriors are
sung who had fallen in love with beautiful damsels
far above them in birth or rank, and whose hand
they could only acquire by some brilliant adventure
or exploit. The heathen poems of the Scandinavian
North are all conceived in the same spirit, and it is
not unreasonable to recognise traces of Scandinavian
influence in English compositions. In later times,
even to the middle ages, this influence is still more
apparent in the ballads and popular songs, which
are only to be found in the northern or old Danish
parts of England.</p>

<p>Many parts of the Edda or Sagas have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
founded on songs in honour of the gods and heroes
worshipped in Scandinavia.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare's "Hamlet" the young prince is
sent to Britain with a letter carried by his two
comrades. But he re-writes the letter and saves his
life.</p>

<p>In the original Amleth legend of Saxo Grammaticus
the two companions of Amleth, carry a wooden
rune-carvel. But he cuts away some of the staves
and adds others, so that the letter now tells the
British king to slay the messengers, and to give his
daughter in marriage to Amleth.</p>

<p>In the "Historie of Hamlet," London, 1608, we
read, "Now to bear him company were assigned
two of Fengons' ministers, bearing letters engraved
on wood, that contained Hamlet's death, in such
sort as he had advertised to the King of England.
But the subtle Danish prince, being at sea, whilst
his companions slept, raced out the letters that
concerned his death, and instead thereof graved
others."</p>

<p>These fairy tales of the giants, dwarfs, and
heroes, are not senseless stories written for the
amusement of the idle; but they contain the deep
faith or religion of our forefathers, which roused
them to brave actions, and inspired them with strength
and courage. These Sagas existed for over four
hundred years, until they exchanged their hero-god
for St. Martin, and their Thumar, for St. Peter or
St. Oswald, when their glory in Scandinavia fell
before the preaching of the Cross.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Art.</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;"><img id="ip_174" src="images/i_210.jpg" width="480" height="453" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">Bractaetes.</div></div>

<p>Previous to their conquest of England, the Danes
are said to have been unacquainted with the art of
coining money. They are said to have imitated the
Byzantine coins, by making the so-called "Bractaetes,"
which were stamped only on the one side,
and were mostly used as ornaments. The art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
coinage was very ancient in England. It was the
custom of the Anglo-Saxon coiners to put their
names on the coins which they struck. In the
eighth and ninth centuries the names of the coiners
are purely Anglo-Saxon. But in the tenth century,
and especially after the year 950, pure Danish or
Scandinavian names begin to appear; for instance,
Thurmo, Grim, under King Edgar (959&ndash;975), and
Rafn, Thurstan, under King Edward (975&ndash;978);
also Ingolf, Hargrim, and others.</p>

<p>These Scandinavian names are mostly found in
the coins minted in the North of England, or in
districts which were early occupied by the Danes.
Under King Ethelred II., who contended so long
with Canute the Great before the Danish conquest
of England was completed, the number of Scandinavian
coiners arose rapidly, with the Danish power,
and the names of forty or fifty may be found on the
coins of Ethelred alone. Even after the fall of the
Danish power, they are to be met with in almost the
same number as before on the coins of the Anglo-Saxon
King, Edward the Confessor. These coins
prove much and justify us in inferring a long
continued coinage.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The great hoard of silver coins found at
Cuerdale in 1840, some two miles above Preston,
were buried in a leaden chest, near an ancient ford
of the river Ribble. This treasure composed the
war chest of the Danish army, which was defeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
at this ford early in the tenth century, on its retreat
into Northumbria. It contained nearly one thousand
English coins of Alfred the Great, and some forty-five
of Edward the Elder. The latest date of any
of these coins being of the latter reign, the date
of the hoard being buried may be fixed between
the years 900 and 925. Many of the coins were
continental, belonging to the coast of Western
France, and from the district round the mouth of
the river Seine. The appearance of this money
agrees with the early records of the Saxon
Chronicle, that of the year 897, which tells us that
"the Danish army divided, one part went into the
Eastern Counties, and the other into Northumbria,
and those who were without money, procured ships
and went southwards over the sea to the Seine."</p>

<p>The other Chronicle of 910 states that, "a great
fleet came hither from the south, from Brittany, and
greatly ravaged the Severn, but there they afterwards
nearly all perished." It may be supposed
that the remnant of this band became united with
the main Danish army, and would account for the
large proportion of foreign money. The bulk of
the coins were Danish, minted by Danish kings of
Northumbria.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;"><img id="ip_176a" src="images/i_216.jpg" width="340" height="600" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>From these circumstances, we may believe, this
hoard to have been the treasure or war chest of this
retreating army. This Cuerdale hoard is by far
the largest found in Lancashire; it contained 10,000
silver coins, and nearly 1,000 ounces of silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
ingots. A smaller find, made at an early date, was
the hoard of 300 silver pennies, discovered in 1611
at Harkirke, which lies on the sea coast between
Crosby and Formby. Of this collection, some 35
coins were engraved at the latter part of the tenth
century.</p>

<p>This engraving shows that these coins were
minted by Alfred, Edward the Elder, and the
Danish king Canute, and the ecclesiastical coinages
of York and East Anglia. These coins were
buried within a few years of the deposit at Cuerdale.
We have numerous records of other Danish finds.</p>

<p>At Halton Moor, five miles above Lancaster, the
discovery was made in 1815 of a silver cup of
graceful design, containing 860 silver coins of
Canute, with ornaments, which included a torque
of silver wire. Mr. J. Coombe, of the British
Museum, describes the coins as 21 Danish, and 379
of Canute. The latter being nearly all of one type,
having on the obverse side the Head of the King
with Helmet and Sceptre, and on the reverse a
cross, within the inner circle, with amulets in the
four angles.</p>

<p>The silver cup found on Halton Moor contained,
in addition to the coins of Canute, a silver torque,
which had been squeezed into the vessel. Both
these silver articles are highly decorated and of
great interest. The cup weighed over ten ounces,
and was composed of metal containing three parts
silver with one part copper. It appeared to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
been gilt originally, some of the gold still remaining,
which was of very pale colour. The ornamentation
consisted of four circular compartments, divided by
branches which terminated in the heads of animals,
in Arabesque style. In these compartments are a
panther and a butting bull alternately. This
ornament is included inside two beautiful borders,
which encircle the cup in parallel lines. The
torque is of equal interest, and is a peculiar example
of Danish wire-work metal rings, twisted and
plated, with the ends beaten together for a double
fastening. The face of this portion of the necklace,
which is flattened, was decorated with small
triangular pieces fixed by curious rivets. It was of
pure silver and weighed six ounces six penny-weights.</p>

<p>Along with these deposits were some gold pieces,
struck on one side only, with a rough outline of a
human head. Similar pieces have been found in
Denmark, and the Danish element is predominant
in the whole decoration.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Viking Age.</span></h3>

<p>Before the Normans came our district was
Scandinavian. From the year 876 they began to
settle and behaved not as raiders but as colonists.
They wanted homes and settled quietly down.</p>

<p>In the course of 200 years their descendants
became leading landowners, as we see from the
Norse names of the 12th century records.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Naturally the art of the district must have been
influenced by such people: especially by the
Scandinavians who had lived in Ireland, till then a
very artistic country. Whether Irish taught Norse
or <i>vice versa</i>, we see that there was a quantity of
artistic work produced especially along the seaboard,
and we are lucky in having analogies not
far to seek.</p>

<p>In the Isle of Man the earliest series of Crosses
have 11th century runes and figure subjects from
the Edda and the Sigurd story which were late 11th
century. Mr. Kermode, F.S.A., Scot., dates them
1050&ndash;1150 (Saga book of Viking Club, Vol. I.,
p. 369). We have them in the remains in Man a
kindred race to ours in the age before the Normans
came: and we find resemblances between these
Manx Crosses and some of ours both in subject and
in style. In subjects the 11th century Crosses of
Kirk Andreas, Jurby, and Malew find a parallel at
Halton, which Mr. Calverley places late in 11th
century and attributes to people under strong
Scandinavian influence: but Danish as it happens
rather than Norse.</p>

<p>The Halton Crosses are not Norse in style.
They are like the late pre-Norman work in Yorkshire
where the Danes lived.</p>

<p>Then the Hogback stones have to be placed.
We have fixed the Gosforth and Plumland
examples by their dragonesque work as of the
Viking settlement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
All these have the chain pattern, which Mr.
Calverley called the Tree Yggdrasil or Tree of
Existence, which shows that these monuments are
of Viking origin.</p>

<p>From what models or pattern did these early
sculptors copy their designs? It is sometimes said
that they imitated MSS.: assuming that MSS.
were fairly common and placed in the stone carver's
hands. This is far less likely than that sculptors,
at a distance from good models in stone, copied
patterns from metal work which were the most
portable, and most accessible of all forms of art,
in the days before printing was invented.</p>

<p>Suppose, to make it plainer, the sorrowing
survivor bids the British workman carve a Cross
for the dead. "What like shall I work it?" says
the mason. "Like the fair Crosses of England or
Ireland, a knot above, and a knot below, and so
forth." "But," says the mason, and he might say
it in the 10th century, "I have never been in
England or Ireland or seen your Crosses." Then
answers the patron, "Make it like this swordhilt."
(Calverley.)</p>

<p>The earlier Irish Christians were highly intellectual
and literary, but not at first artistic. Literature
in all races precedes art; it would be contrary to
all historical analogy if Patrick and Columba had
lived in the artistic atmosphere of the eighth and
ninth century in Ireland. Patrick's bell is no great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
credit to Assicus his coppersmith: his crosier was
a plain stick. There is no indication in our remains
that Irish missionaries of the seventh century
brought a single art idea into the country. It was
the Irish Viking Christians of the twelfth century
who did.</p>

<p>Mr. George Stephens, in his "Old Northern
Runic Monuments of Scandinavia and England,"
vol. iii., under the heading "Runic Remains and
Runic Writings," <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I believe these stones, however altered and
conventionalised, were all originally made for
worship as gods or fetishes, elfstones, or what not,
but in fact, at first as phallic symbols, the Zinga and
the Zoni, creation and preservation, placed on the
tumulus as triumphant emblems of Light out of
Darkness, Life after Death. And the <i>priapus</i> and
<i>cups</i> sometimes seen on burial-urns, must have the
same meaning. Several of the grave minnes bearing
old Norse runes were worship stones, carved
with regular cups, etc., <i>ages before</i> they were used
a second time for funereal purposes."</p>

<p>Prof. J.&nbsp;F. Simpson, M.D., Edinburgh, has a
paper "On the Cup Cuttings and Ring Cuttings on
the Calder Stones near Liverpool," in the Transactions
of the Historic Society of Lancashire and
Cheshire, vol. xvii., 1865, in which he states <span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"The Calder Stones near Liverpool afford an
interesting and remarkable example of these cup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
and ring carvings upon this variety of stones&mdash;or, in
words, upon the stones of a small megalithic circle.
Some of the Calder Stones afford ample evidence
of modern chiselling as marked by the sharpness
and outray figurings. But in addition to these there
are cut upon them, though in some parts greatly
faded away, sculpturings of cups and concentric
rings similar to those found in various parts of
England and Scotland, remarkable for not only
their archaic carvings, perfect and entire similarity
to those found elsewhere, but still more from the
fact that we have here presented upon a single circle
almost every known and recognised type of these
cuttings.</p>

<p>The Calder circle is about six yards in diameter,
consists of five stones which are still upright and one
that is fallen. The stones consists of slabs and
blocks of red sandstone, all different in size and
shape. The fallen stone is small, and shows nothing
on its exposed side, but possibly if turned over some
markings might be discovered on its other surface.
Of the five standing stones the largest of the set,
No. 1, is a sandstone slab between 576 feet in height
and in breadth. On its outer surface, or the surface
turned to the exterior of the circle, there is a flaw
above from disintegration and splintering of the
stone: but the remaining portion of the surface
presents between 30 and 40 cup depressions varying
from 2 to 3 and a half inches in diameter, and
at its lowest and left-hand corner is a concentric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
circle about a foot in diameter, consisting of four
enlarging rings, but apparently without any central
depression. The opposite surface of this stone
(No. 1) is that directed to the interior of the circle,
has near its centre a cup cut upon it, with the
remains of one surrounding ring. On the right side
of this single-ringed cup are the faded remains of
a concentric circle of three rings. To the left of it
there is another three-ringed circle with a central
depression, but the upper portions of the ring are
broken off. Above it is a double-ringed cup, with
this peculiarity, that the external ring is a volute
leading from the central cup, and between the outer
and inner ring is a fragmentary line of apparently
another volute making a double-ringed spiral which
is common on some Irish stones, as on those of the
great archaic mausoleum at New Grange, but
extremely rare in Great Britain. At the very base
of this stone towards the left are two small volutes,
one with a central depression or cup, and the other
seemingly without it. One of these small volutes
consists of three turns, the other of two.</p>

<p>The cup and ring cuttings have been discovered
in a variety of relations and positions. Some are
sculptured on the surface of rocks <i>in situ</i>&mdash;on large
stones placed inside and outside the walls of old
British cities and camps, on blocks used in the construction
of the olden dwellings and strongholds of
archaic living man, in the interior of the chambered
sepulchres and kistvaens of the archaic dead, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
monoliths and on cromlechs, and repeatedly in
Scotland on megalithic or so-called "Druidical"
circles.</p>

<p>The name Calder Stones is derived from Norse
Calder or Caldag, the calf-garth or yard enclosed
to protect young cattle from straying.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Norse and Danish Grave Mounds.</span></h3>

<p>Amongst the ancient monuments of Britain the
well-known remains called Druidical Circles hold
a foremost place, though their use, and the people
by whom they were erected, are questions which
still remain matters of dispute. The Stone enclosures
of Denmark, which resemble the Circles of
Cumbria in many respects, mainly differ from them,
in that they are found in connection with burial
chambers, whilst the latter are generally situated
on the flat surface of moors, with nothing to indicate
that they have ever been used for sepulchural
purposes. Therefore wherever no urns or other
remains have been found, we have negative evidence
that the place was not intended for a place of
sepulture.</p>

<p>Cairns which are the most undisputed form of a
Celtic burial place were once very numerous in the
northern districts: but a great many have long since
been removed. The graves of Norway bear an
outward resemblance to the Celtic Cairn, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
main cause appears to be that in mountainous
countries stones are more easily procurable than
earth. Where a doubt exists as to the proprietorship
of these mounds, the only means of deciding
is by an examination of the interior. The Norse
Cairn should enclose a stone chest or wooden
chamber and iron weapons. The Norwegians
burned the body until about their conversion to
Christianity.</p>

<p>Tumuli or barrows still remain in great numbers.
As far as records have been kept of those removed,
nearly all must be claimed for the Bronze age, and
the main part of those yet standing are essentially
of a Danish character. In the description of this
class of graves, we have no actual mention of iron
antiquities.</p>

<p>The Cairn called Mill Hill, Westmoreland,
appears to have been a Celtic burial place, whilst
Loden How was more probably Danish than Norse.
Four different names are found in connection with
sepulchres of this kind, viz., "how, raise, barrow,
and hill," but the distinction is principally that of
age, and the order of the words as here placed
indicates the period to which each belongs.</p>

<p>Few traces of the Iron age can be regarded as
exclusively Norwegian wherever the body has been
burned. Ormstead, near Penrith, was possibly a
Norse burial place; while Thulbarrow, in the same
neighbourhood, was in all probability Danish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Memorial stones still remain in considerable
numbers, the most remarkable of which is the Nine
Standards in Westmoreland. Several villages
called Unthank take their names from Monuments
no longer in existence, the word being in English
"onthink," and the phrase "to think on" is still
current in the dialect.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Mythology.</span></span></h2>

<p>The religious conceptions of the most famous
nations of antiquity are connected with the beginnings
of civilisation. We are told by Dr. Wägner,
in his work "Asgard and the Gods," of the traditions
of our northern ancestors, the story of the myths
and legends of Norse antiquity. The first of their
heroes was Odin, the god of battles, armed with his
war spear, followed by the Walkyries, who consecrate
the fallen heroes with a kiss, and bear them
away to the halls of the gods, where they enjoy the
feasts of the blessed. Later, Odin invents the
Runes, through which he gains the power of understanding
and ruling all things. He thus becomes
the spirit of nature, the all-father. Then the ash
tree, "Yggdrasil," grew up; the tree of the universe,
of time, and life. The boughs stretched out to
heaven, and over-shadowed Walhalla, the hall of
the heroes. This world-tree was evergreen, watered
daily by the fateful Norns, and could not wither
until the last battle should be fought, where life,
time, and the world were all to pass away. This
was related by a skald, the northern bard, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
warriors while resting from the fatigue of fighting,
by tables of mead.</p>

<p>The myths were founded on the belief of the
Norse people, regarding the creation of the world,
gods, and men, and thus we find them preserved in
the songs of the "Edda. The vague notion of a
Deity who created and ruled over all things had its
rise in the impression made upon the human mind
by the unity of nature. The sun, moon, and stars,
clouds and mists, storms and tempests, appeared to
be higher powers, and took distinct forms in the
mind of man. The sun was first regarded as a
fiery bird which flew across the sky, then as a horse,
and afterwards as a chariot and horses; the clouds
were cows, from whose udders the fruitful rain
poured down. The storm-wind appeared as a great
eagle that stirred the air by the flapping of his
enormous wings. These signs of nature seemed to
resemble animals. On further consideration it was
found that man was gifted with the higher mental
powers. It was then acknowledged that the figure
of an animal was an improper representation of a
divine being. They thus inverted the words of
Holy writ, that "God created man in his own image,"
and men now made the gods in their own likeness,
but still regarded them as greater, more beautiful,
and more ideal than themselves.</p>

<p>From the titles of these pagan gods we derive
the names of our days of the week, and thus we
continue to perpetuate in our daily life the story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Norse mythology. The first day of the week was
dedicated to the worship of the sun. The second
day to that of the moon. The third day was sacred
to Tyr, the god of war. The fourth day was sacred
to Wodin, or Odin, the chief deity. The fifth day
was sacred to Thor, the god of thunder. The sixth
day of the week, Friday, was sacred to Frigga, the
wife of the great Odin. The seventh or last day
of the week was dedicated by the Romans to Saturn,
one of the planets, their god of agriculture, whose
annual festival was a time of unrestrained enjoyment.</p>

<p>The "Eddas" were two Scandinavian books,
the earlier a collection of mythological and heroic
songs, and the other a prose composition of old and
venerable traditions. These books were meant for
the instruction of the Norse skalds and bards. It
is believed that the learned Icelander, Saemund,
the Wise, compiled the older Edda in 1056 from
oral traditions, and partly from runic writings. The
younger Edda is supposed to have been compiled
by Bishop Snorri Sturlason in 1178, and this
collection goes by the name of Snorra-Edda. The
language was developed by means of the sagas and
songs which had been handed down among the
people from generation to generation.</p>

<p>The Norns were the three fatal sisters, who used
to watch over the springs of water, and appeared
by the cradle of many a royal infant to give it
presents. On such occasions two of them were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
generally friendly to the child, while the third
prophesied evil concerning it. In the pretty story
of the "Sleeping Beauty" these Norns appear as
the fairies.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mythical Gods.</span></h3>

<p>Bragi was the son of the wave maidens and the
god of poetry. He was married to the blooming
Induna, who accompanied him to Asgard, where
she gave the gods every morning the apples of
eternal youth.</p>

<p>Tyr, the god of war, was tall, slender as a pine,
and bravely defended the gods from the terrible
Fenris-Wolf. In doing so he lost his hand, and
was held in high honour by the people. Baldur,
the holy one, and the giver of all good, was the son
of Odin. His mother Frigga entreated all
creatures to spare the well-beloved, but she overlooked
the weak mistletoe bough. The gods in
boisterous play threw their weapons at Baldur, and
the dart made of the fatal bough was thrown by the
blind Hödur with deadly effect.</p>

<p>Forseti, the son of Baldur, resembled his father
in holiness and righteousness, was the upholder of
eternal law. The myth shows him seated on a
throne teaching the Norsemen the benefits of the
law, surrounded by his twelve judges.</p>

<p>Loki, the crafty god, was the father of the Fenris-Wolf,
and the snake. He was the god of warmth
and household fire, and was held to be the corrupter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
of gods, and the spirit of evil. It was Loki who
formed the fatal dart, which he placed in the hands
of the blind Hödur, which caused the death of
Baldur. After the murder of Baldur, Loki conceals
himself on a distant mountain, and hides himself
under a waterfall. Here the avengers catch him
in a peculiar net which he had invented for the
destruction of others. They bind him to a rock,
where a snake drops poison upon his face, which
makes him yell with pain. His faithful wife,
Sigyn, catches the poison in a cup; but still it
drops upon him whenever the vessel is full. From
this myth it is supposed that Shakspere derived the
story of his greatest drama and tragedy, "Hamlet,"
of the Prince of Denmark. Our forefathers
notion of the last battle, the single combats of the
strong, the burning of the world, are all to be read
in ancient traditions, and we find them described in
the poems of the Skalds. The Norse mythology
makes amends for the tragic end of the divine
drama by concluding with a description of the
renewal of the world. The earth rises fresh and
green out of its ruin, as soon as it has been cleansed
from sin, refined and restored by fire. The gods
assemble on the plains of Ida, and the sons of
Thor bring with them their father's storm-hammer,
a weapon no longer used for fighting, but only for
consecrating what is right and holy. They are
joined by Baldur and Hödur, reconciled and united
in brotherly love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Uller is recorded in the Edda as the cheery and
sturdy god of winter, who cared nothing for wind
and snowstorm, who used to go about on long
journeys on his skates or snow-shoes. These shoes
were compared to a shield, and thus the shield is
called Uller's Ship in many places. When the god
Uller skated over the ice he carried with him his
shield, and deadly arrows and bow made from the
yew-tree. He lived in the Palace Ydalir, the yew
vale. As he protected plants and seeds from the
severe frosts of the north, by covering the ground
with a coating of snow, he was regarded as the
benefactor of mortal men, and was called the friend
of Baldur, the giver of every blessing and joy.
Uller meant divine glory, as Vulder, the Anglo-Saxon
god, was also characterised. This was
probably because the glory of the northern winter
night, which is often brilliantly lighted by the snow,
the dazzling ice, and the Aurora-borealis, the great
northern light. The myths exist in the present like
the stately ruins of a past time, which are no longer
suitable for the use of man. Generations come and
go, their views, actions, and modes of thought
change:</p>

<p>Thousands of years ago our ancestors prayed to
Waruna, the father in heaven; thousands of years
later the Romans entered their temple and worshipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Jupiter, the father in heaven, while the
Teutonic races worshipped the All-father. After
the lapse of centuries now we turn in all our sorrow
and adversities to our Father which is in heaven.
In the thousands of years which may pass we shall
not have grown beyond this central point of
religion.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In his masterly work on "Hero-Worship,"
Carlyle traces the growth of the "Hero as
Divinity" from the Norse Mythology in the
following words: "How the man Odin came to be
considered a god, the chief god? His people knew
no limits to their admiration of him; they had as
yet no scale to measure admiration by. Fancy your
own generous heart's love of some greatest man
expanding till it transcended all bounds, till it filled
and overflowed the whole field of your thought.</p>

<p>Then consider what mere Time will do in such
cases; how if a man was great while living, he
becomes tenfold greater when dead.</p>

<p>What an enormous 'camera-obscura' magnifier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
is Tradition! How a thing grows in the human
memory, in the human imagination, when love,
worship, and all that lies in the human heart, is there
to encourage it. And in the darkness, in the entire
ignorance; without date or document, no book, no
Arundel marble: only here and there some dumb
monumental cairn. Why! in thirty or forty years,
were there no books, any great man would grow
'mythic,' the contemporaries who had seen him,
being once all dead: enough for us to discern far
in the uttermost distance some gleam as of a small
real light shining in the centre of that enormous
camera-obscura image: to discern that the centre of
it all was not a madness and nothing, but a sanity
and something.</p>

<p>This light kindled in the great dark vortex of the
Norse mind, dark but living, waiting only for the
light, this is to me the centre of the whole. How
such light will then shine out, and with wondrous
thousand-fold expansion spread itself in forms and
colours, depends not on <i>it</i>, so much as in the
National Mind recipient of it. Who knows to what
unnameable subtleties of spiritual law all these
Pagan fables owe their shape! The number
twelve, divisiblest of all, which could be halved,
quartered, parted into three, into six, the most
remarkable number, this was enough to determine
the Signs of the Zodiac, the number of Odin's sons,
and innumerable other twelves.</p>

<p>Odin's Runes are a significant feature of him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Runes, and the miracles of "magic" he worked by
them, make a great feature in tradition. Runes are
the Scandinavian alphabet; suppose Odin to have
been the inventor of letters as well as "magic"
among that people. It is the greatest invention
man has ever made, this of marking down the
unseen thought that is in him by written characters.
It is a kind of second speech, almost as miraculous
as the first.</p>

<p>You remember the astonishment and incredulity
of Atahaulpa the Peruvian king; how he made the
Spanish soldier, who was guarding him, scratch
Dios on his thumb nail, that he might try the next
soldier with it, to ascertain whether such a miracle
was possible. If Odin brought letters among his
people, he might work magic enough! Writing by
Runes has some air of being original among the
Norsemen; not a Ph&oelig;nician alphabet, but a
Scandinavian one.</p>

<p>Snorro tells us farther that Odin invented poetry;
the music of human speech, as well as that
miraculous runic marking of it.</p>

<p>Transport yourself into the early childhood of
nations; the first beautiful morning light of our
Europe, when all yet lay in fresh young radiance,
as of a great sunrise, and our Europe was first
beginning to think,&mdash;to be!</p>

<p>This Odin, in his rude semi-articulate way, had
a word to speak. A great heart laid open to take
in this great universe, and man's life here, and utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
a great word about it. And now, if we still admire
such a man beyond all others, what must these wild
Norse souls, first awakened with thinking, have
made of him! The rough words he articulated,
are they not the rudimental roots of those English
words we still use? He worked so, in that obscure
element. But he was as a light kindled in it, a
light of intellect, rude nobleness of heart, the only
kind of lights we have yet: he had to shine there,
and make his obscure element a little lighter, as is
still the task of us all.</p>

<p>We will fancy him to be the type Norseman; the
finest Teuton whom that race had yet produced.
He is as a root of many great things; the fruit of
him is found growing, from deep thousands of
years, over the whole field of Teutonic life. Our
own Wednesday, is it not still Odin's day?
Wednesbury, Wansborough, Wanstead, Wandsworth:
Odin grew into England too, these are still
the leaves from that root. He was the chief god to
all the Teutonic peoples; their pattern Norsemen.</p>

<p>The essence of the Scandinavian, as indeed of
all Pagan mythologies, we found to be recognition
of the divineness of nature; sincere communion of
man with the mysterious invisible powers, visibly
seen at work in the world around him.</p>

<p>Sincerity is the great characteristic of it. Amid
all that fantastic congeries of associations and
traditions in their musical mythologies, the main
practical belief a man could have was of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
inflexible destiny, of the valkyrs and the hall of
Odin, and that the one thing needful for a man was
to be brave. The Valkyrs are choosers of the
slain, who lead the brave to a heavenly hall of
Odin: only the base and slavish being thrust elsewhere,
into the realms of Hela, the Death goddess.
This was the soul of the whole Norse Belief.
Valour is still valour. The first duty of a man is
still that of subduing Fear. Snorro tells us they
thought it a shame and misery not to die in battle;
and if a natural death seemed to be coming on,
they would cut wounds in their flesh that Odin
might receive them as warriors slain. Old kings
about to die had their body laid into a ship, the ship
sent forth with sail set and slow fire burning in it;
that once out at sea, it might blaze up into flame,
and in such a manner bury worthily the old hero,
at once in the sky and in the ocean."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Superstitions.</span></span></h2>

<p>The most remarkable instance of the tenacity of
superstitions is the survival of the practice of
"bringing in the New Year." Not only does it
exist among the poor and uneducated, but even
amongst educated people at this festive season. It
is considered an omen of misfortune if the first
person who enters your house on New Year's
morning has a fair complexion or light hair. This
popular prejudice has never been satisfactorily
accounted for, says the late Mr. Charles Hardwick,
in his "Traditions and Superstitions." He says:
"I can only suggest that it most probably arose
from the fact that amongst the Keltic tribes, who
were the earliest immigrants, dark hair prevailed.
This dark characteristic still prevails amongst the
Welsh, Cornish, and Irish of the present day.
When these earlier races came in contact with the
Danes and Norse as enemies, they found their
mortal foes to possess fair skins and light hair.
They consequently regarded the intrusion into their
houses, at the commencement of the year, of one of
the hated race, as a sinister omen. The true Kelt
does not only resent, on New Year's Day, the red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
hair of the Dane, but the brown and flaxen locks of
the German as well." An old writer, Oliver
Matthew, of Shrewsbury, writing in the year 1616,
at the age of 90 years, says it was the custom of the
Danes to place one of their men to live in each
homestead of the conquered race, and this was more
resented than the tribute they had to pay. This
affords another proof that these fair-haired men
were the cause of this present superstition. It is
also considered unlucky to allow anything to be
taken out of the house on New Year's Day, before
something had been brought in. The importation
of the most insignificant article, even a piece of coal,
or something in the nature of food, is sufficient to
prevent this misfortune, which the contrary action
would render inevitable. This sentiment is well
expressed in the following <span class="locked">rhyme:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<span class="i0">Take out, and then take in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bad luck will begin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take in, then take out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good luck comes about.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would be rash to speculate how long superstitions
of this kind will continue to walk hand in
hand with religion; how long traditions from far-off
heathen times will exercise this spell not only in our
remote country places but in enlightened towns. In
the realms of folk-lore, many were firm believers in
witchcraft, in signs and omens, which things were
dreaded with ignorant awe, while the romantic race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
of gipsies look upon occult influences from the
inside, as a means of personal gain.</p>

<p>The prophetic character of the weather during
this period is a superstition common to all the Aryan
tribes. So strongly is this characteristic of the
season felt in Lancashire at the present day, that
many country people may be met with who habitually
found their "forecast" on the appearances of
the heavens on Old Christmas Day. The late Mr.
T.&nbsp;T. Wilkinson relates a singular instance of this
superstition, which shows the stubbornness of
traditional lore, even when subjected to the power
and influence of legislative enactments. He says:
"The use of the old style in effect is not yet extinct
in Lancashire. The writer knows an old man of
Habergham, near Burnley, about 77 years of age,
who always reckons the changes of the seasons in
this manner. He alleges the practice of his father
and grandfather in support of his method, and
states with much confidence that 'Perliment didn't
change t' seasons wen they chang'd day o't'
month.'" A work named "The Shepherd's
Kalender," published in 1709, soberly informs us
that "if New Year's Day in the morning opens with
dusky red clouds, it denotes strife and debates
among great ones, and many robberies to happen
that year."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Helm Wind.</span></h3>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Kirkoswald, on the
Eden in Cumberland, a district prolific in Arthurian
legends, it is said that a "peculiar wind called the
'Helm Wind,' sometimes blows with great fury in
that part of the country. It is believed by some
persons to be an electrical phenomenon." This
fact may have some remote connection with the
superstition under consideration. Sir Walter Scott's
version of the legend is as follows: "A daring horse
jockey sold a black horse to a man of venerable and
antique appearance, who appointed the remarkable
hillock upon the Eildon Hills, called the Lucken
Hare, as the place where at twelve o'clock at night
he should receive the price. He came and his
money was paid in ancient coin, and he was invited
by his customer to view his residence. The trader
in horses followed his guide in the deepest astonishment
through several long ranges of stalls, in each
of which a horse stood motionless, while an armed
warrior lay equally still at the charger's feet. 'All
these men,' said the Wizard in a whisper, 'will
awaken at the battle of Sheriffmoor.' At the
extremity of this extraordinary depôt hung a sword
and a horn, which the Prophet pointed out to the
horse dealer, as containing the means of dissolving
the spell. The man in confusion, took the horn and
attempted to wind it. The horses instantly started
in their stalls, stamped and shook their bridles; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
men arose, and clashed their armour; and the mortal
terrified at the tumult he had excited, dropped the
horn from his hand. A voice like that of a giant,
louder even than the tumult around, pronounced
these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<span class="i0">"Woe to the coward that ever he was born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That did not draw the sword before he blew the horn!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mistletoe was supposed to protect the homestead
from fire and other disaster, and, like other
mysterious things, was believed to be potent in
matters relating to courtship and matrimony. It is
to this sentiment we owe the practice of kissing
under the bush formed of holly and mistletoe during
Christmas festivities. This matrimonial element in
the mistletoe is artistically presented in the
Scandinavian mythology. Freigga, the mother of
Baldr, had rendered him invulnerable against all
things formed out of the then presumed four
elements, fire, air, earth, and water. The mistletoe
was believed to grow from none of these elements.
But she overlooked the one insignificant branch of
the mistletoe, and it was by an arrow fashioned from
it that the bright day-god Baldr, the Scandinavian
counterpart of Apollo and Bel, was killed by the
blind Hodr or Heldr. The gods, however, restored
him to life, and dedicated the mistletoe to his
mother, who is regarded as the counterpart of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
classical Venus. Hence its importance in affairs of
love and courtship. It is not improbable that the
far-famed dart of Cupid may have some relation to
the mistletoe arrow, to which the beautiful Baldr
succumbed.</p>

<p>The medicinal qualities of the mistletoe tree were
also in high repute. Its healing power was shared
by the ash tree, which was the "Cloud tree" of the
Norsemen. The ash (Norse "askr,") was the tree
out of which the gods formed the first man, who was
thence called Askr. The ash was among the
Greeks, an image of the clouds, and the mother of
men.</p>

<p>Other Christmas customs and superstitions are
peculiar to Lancashire. The white thorn is supposed
to possess supernatural power, and certain
trees of this class, in Lancashire called Christmas
thorns, are believed to blossom only on Old
Christmas Day. Mr. Wilkinson says that in the
neighbourhood of Burnley many people will yet
travel a considerable distance "at midnight, in order
to witness the blossoming." The Boar's Head yet
forms a chief object amongst the dishes of Christmas
festivities. Among the impersonations of natural
phenomena, the wild boar represented the "ravages
of the whirlwind that tore up the earth." In all
mythologies the boar is the animal connected with
storm and lightning. There yet exists a superstition
prevalent in Lancashire to the effect that pigs can
"see the wind." Dr. Kuhm says that in Westphalia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
this superstition is a prevalent one. The tradition
is at least three or four thousand years old.
Lancashire has many stories of the pranks played
by the wild boar or demon pig, removing the stones
in the night on the occasion of the building of
churches. Stories of this nature are to be found
respecting Winwick, where a rude carving resembling
a hog fastened to a block of stone, by a collar,
is to be seen built into the tower of the present
Church. Burnley and Rochdale Churches, and
Samlesbury Church, near Preston, possess similar
traditions.</p>

<p>All Celtic nations have been accustomed to the
worship of the Sun. It was a custom that everywhere
prevailed in ancient times to celebrate a feast
at the Winter Solstice, by which men testified their
joy at seeing this great luminary return again to this
part of the heavens. This was the greatest
solemnity of the year. They called it in many
places "Yole," or "Yuul," from the word "Hiaul"
and "Houl," which even at this day signifies sun
in the language of Cornwall. "Heulo" in modern
Welsh means to "shine as the Sun." And thus we
may derive our word halo. Some writers, including
the Venerable Bede, derive Yule from "hvoel," a
wheel, meaning the return of the Sun's annual
course after the Winter Solstice.</p>

<p>While the Scandinavian element is regarded by
modern writers as the predominating feature in the
composition of Englishmen, the Danish has been
the pre-eminent force in forming the character of
the race which dominates the Lancashire people of
to-day. In our survey of the progress of the race,
from the earliest settlement of the Danes, we find
the impression of their footprints in the place-names
of the county, which are our oldest and most
enduring monuments. Following their character of
daring and venture, we have established a maritime
power which is the envy of the world. The same
spirit which formed our early settlements in
Lancashire has founded colonies in every quarter of
the globe. The enterprise of the early "copemen"
has developed into our mercantile fleet, which
controls the carrying trade of the seas. The voice
of their language still resounds in the names of our
laws, the "hundreds" of the county, and in our
system of administration, and also in the political
freedom which has established the saying that
"What Lancashire says to-day, England will say
to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
In the earliest record of agricultural progress we
find the Danes have given us the name of
"husbandry," and the modern implement called the
"plough." Therefore, in forming an estimate of
the benefits which have resulted from our intercourse
with the Danes, the primary industry of
agriculture and dairy produce must not be omitted.
In all other branches of commercial activity, by the
application of scientific methods, unbounded
progress has been achieved. Has the oldest
industry of the county had a share in this attainment
of wealth, or its rural population derived advancement?
For a period of half-a-century our agricultural
leaders have held competitions known as
agricultural shows, where valuable prizes have been
given for live stock of all descriptions, and rewards
for every design of mechanical appliance for
agriculture. To a stranger visiting these shows, it
would appear that we brooked no rival in the
production of dairy produce. What are the facts
disclosed by the figures for the past 25 or 50 years?
In the "Year Book of the Lancashire Past Agricultural
Students' Association" we are told that
Parliament handed over, in the year 1890, to local
authorities, large sums of money for purposes of
technical instruction, and that "this marks the really
substantial beginning of agricultural education in
Lancashire."</p>

<p>With this statement, made at the opening of the
twentieth century, it may be interesting to notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
the increase of our imports of Danish dairy produce
for a period of eleven <span class="locked">years:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Danish Agriculture.</span></h3>

<p>During the past ten years, says Mr. Consul L.
C. Liddell in his report for 1908, Denmark has
witnessed a considerable increase.</p>

<p>The exports of agricultural produce, which in
1904 were worth £18,400,000, reached £22,400,000
in 1908. The amount of butter exported to the
United Kingdom reaches 96.1 per cent. of the total;
of bacon, 97.5 per cent.; and of eggs, 98.8 per cent.
The remainder of the butter and bacon goes
principally to Germany. Nearly the entire export
of horses and cattle is absorbed by the German
market, whilst three-fifths of the beef also finds its
way thither, the remainder going to Norway.</p>

<p>The labour question has, as in other years,
attracted much attention. The number of Swedish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
and Finnish labourers is decreasing, and it is from
Galicia that Denmark would now appear to recruit
her farm hands. The number of Galician "season"
labourers in 1908 reached 8,000, or about 1,000
more than in 1907. The co-operative organisations
approached the Prime Minister with the proposal
that free passes should be granted on the State
railway system to any unemployed at Copenhagen
having a knowledge of field work to help in
farming. This attempt to organise a "back to the
land" movement is not expected to be attended
with success.</p>

<p>These figures show an increase of nearly double in
eleven years, or an increase of eight millions, and
an increase of two millions from 1906 to 1907.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the bulk of Danish
produce comes to the Manchester market, and is
distributed from that centre. An analysis of the
1907 imports from Denmark gives the following
details:&mdash;Butter £10,192,587, eggs £1,774,319,
fish £91,031, lard £17,723, bacon £5,385,275, pork
£200,000. The item of bacon for 1907 shows an
increase of one million pounds over the year 1906.</p>

<p>The import of Danish produce began in the early
sixties of last century, and the quality was so
indifferent that we are told it was fortunate if two
casks of butter were good out of every five. Even
then the quality was superior to Irish butter in its
taste and appearance. The population of Denmark
is two and a half millions, and the cultivated area of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
land is seven million acres. The yield of crops to
the acre is 28 bushels of wheat, while in England it
is 33 bushels. In barley the yield is 30 bushels to
our 35 bushels, and in oats it is 33 bushels to our 42.
These figures show the comparative fruitfulness of
the land to be in favour of England. The live
stock per 1,000 population in Denmark is 711 cattle
to our 267, and pigs 563 to our 82. The total
imports for twenty years show that our dairy produce
from abroad has doubled, and is increasing at a
rapid rate.</p>

<p>Comparisons of Danish methods of farming to-day
cannot be made with the present conditions existing
in Lancashire or Yorkshire, but can only be made
by the modern conditions now obtaining in Essex
under Lord Rayleigh.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Crops Diminishing.</span></h3>

the past sixty years? Mr. Cobden maintained that
Free Trade would do no injury to agriculture. The

and <span class="locked">1907:&mdash;</span></p>

Sixty years ago home-grown wheat produced flour
for twenty-four millions of our <span class="locked">population.<a name="FNanchor_G" id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a></span> To-day
it produces flour for four and a half millions. The
acreage under wheat has been reduced in the last
thirty years to one-half in England, to one-third
in Scotland, and to one-fifth in Ireland. The same
is true of green crops. Nine hundred thousand
acres less are under crops than were thirty years ago.
The same may be said of the area under hop
cultivation, which has been reduced every year.
The only bright spot in the review of our agricultural
position, extending over many years, is to be found
in the growth of fruit, although this has not
increased as rapidly as foreign importations.</p>

<p>The result of these changes during the last thirty
years has been an increase of imports of agricultural
produce of eighty millions. Our imports of wheat
have increased by thirty-two millions, our imports
of dairy produce have increased by twenty-one
millions, and eggs alone have increased by four
millions sterling a year; while fruit and vegetables
have increased by ten and a half millions. The
effect of this must be the increased dependence of
our population on foreign supplies. Agriculture
finds employment for a million less than it did sixty
years ago. These are facts and not opinions, and
we are compelled to use the figures of the general
national imports, as the details of the counties are
not available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">National Savings.</span></h3>

<p>Statesmen tell us that the Post Office Savings
Bank deposits are a fair indication of the industrial
prosperity. In the report of these Post Office
Savings Banks we find that Denmark heads the list
with £15 11s. per head of the population, while the
United Kingdom comes ninth in the list with a sum
of £4 11s. per head of the population.</p>

<p>The economy of waste has been the keynote of
wealth to many industries, and the adaptability of
labour to changed conditions has marked the
survival of more than one centre of commercial
activity. Individual cases are not wanting to prove
that men who have been found unfit to follow their
work in mills and town employments through weak
health or the effect of accidents, have succeeded,
by the aid of a small capital, in becoming model
farmers, and have demonstrated the variety of crops
and stock which can be raised on a single farm.
The bye-products of the manufacturers are often
the source of success, and these are the most
neglected in the itinerary of the farmer.</p>

<p>The greatest problem which confronts our
municipal authorities is the profitable disposal of
sewage. Where sewage farms are maintained they
are invariably conducted at a heavy loss to the
ratepayers, while the adjoining farm tenants often
succeed in making profits. To reclaim the land
which has gone out of cultivation, by the application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of unemployed labour and the disposal of waste and
sewage, provides the solution of a difficulty which
may become a source of wealth, and restore the
prosperity of a lost industry.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cost of Agricultural Education.</span></h3>

<p>A White paper just issued by the Board of
Education gives particulars as to the amount spent
by County Councils in England and Wales on
agricultural education.</p>

<p>The amounts vary considerably in the different
counties for the year ending March, 1908. In
England, Lancashire takes the lead with £7,485,
and in Wales the county of Carmarthen is prominent
with £597.</p>

<p>The gross total amounted to £79,915, of which
£21,662 was in grants to schools and colleges,
£9,876 for scholarships, and £12,433 for dairy
instruction.</p>

<p>The figures are approximate owing to the
difficulty of analysing education accounts.</p>

<p>There are not wanting those who say that farming
cannot be made to pay in England. Essex has
quite a different experience. For here farms,
varying in size from 250 acres to 5,000 and over,
have been made to return very good profits. The
whole secret lies in the work being conducted on
scientific principles, and the careful watching of
every penny expended, as well as giving the
labourers a direct interest in getting good results.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
On Lord Rayleigh's estate, Terling, which comprises
about 5,000 acres, striking results have been obtained
during the past twenty years, his successes being
attributed to the use of business and scientific
methods. For many years past his lordship's
brother, the Hon. E.&nbsp;G. Strutt&mdash;probably one of the
most experienced practical farmers in England&mdash;has
had the management of the property, and has
shown that farming can be carried on with a profit
in this country.</p>

<p>Essex is described as flat, but in the neighbourhood
of Terling, which abuts on the Great Eastern
Railway line at Witham, there are numerous gently
undulating plains, and even at this time of the year
a stroll along the lanes in the neighbourhood reveals
many pleasant surprises. Here and there the
hedgerows are already bursting into delicate green
buds, and in some places the crops sown during the
early winter for spring are showing above the rich
dark brow soil. And many are the birds which are
already, as it were, getting into voice for the spring.
The county hereabouts is heavily wooded, the chief
trees being oak, ash, and elm. Many of these are
veritable giants and monarchs of the forest, now
standing out alone on the sky-line in all their
nakedness of winter outline, then in small groups,
again in such numbers as to become forests. On
every hand are signs of activity. Ploughing for the
moment is all over, though there are still fields of
stubble which have to be turned over and prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
for crops in the near future. Fields which have
already been ploughed are being heavily manured
in readiness for sowing. And herein lies one of the
secrets of the successful farming prevailing in this
favoured neighbourhood. Everyone knows, but
not everyone acts upon the knowledge, that as the
fertility of the soil is exhausted fresh nutriment must
be given. The observance of this rule brings its
own reward, as many have learned to their advantage.
Hedging and ditching are in progress, and
by the time that all hands will be required on the
land for ploughing, scarifying, harrowing, and
sowing, hedges will have been trimmed and ditches
cleaned.</p>

<p>Some eighteen or twenty years ago Lord Rayleigh
decided to offer all his farm labourers, who number
about 250, bonuses on the profits of their industry.
This scheme proved eminently successful; so much
so, indeed, that Lord Rayleigh has now gone a step
further and offered to give every man who cares to
invest his savings in his farms 4 per cent. interest
on such money, and a share in any profits which may
accrue after that dividend has been paid. A very
large proportion of the men employed have taken
advantage of this offer, which gives them close upon
2 per cent. more than they were getting from the
Post Office Savings Bank, where they had been in
the habit of putting their money, for they are a
thoroughly respectable, self-respecting, and frugal
community. It is now just a year since this offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
was first made, and the employees put up over
£1,000, in sums ranging from £1 to £100, the latter
sum coming from a man who had banked all the
bonuses he earned, along with savings from twenty-five
years' earnings.</p>

<p>Lord Rayleigh's idea was to get the men not only
to study thrift, but to take a keener interest in their
daily work. It has been said that that man is a
public benefactor who gets two blades of grass to
flourish where but one grew before. His lordship
has a far higher satisfaction in advancing the
position of the men in his employment. In effect
this is what he said to them: "My farms represent
so much money to me; now for every £1 which you
put in I will guarantee you 4 per cent. After we
have all had our 4 per cent., such surplus profit as
may be left, if any, will be divided between us <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro
rata</i>." The result of the first year's farming under
this form of co-partnership has been very satisfactory.
Everyone has not only been paid the
guaranteed 4 per cent., which was distributed
recently, but each labourer has also received a share
in the sum which was over after paying out that
amount. While Mr. Strutt declined to disclose the
exact amount of the remaining profit, he hinted that
the extra interest might quite possibly be as much as
a further 4 per cent. Whatever it is, every labourer
who put his savings into Lord Rayleigh's hands is
congratulating himself upon his good fortune, and,
as saving begets saving, there is a prospect that none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
of these beneficiaries will ever need the old age
pension.</p>

<p>Lord Rayleigh has made only two stipulations
with his men, both aimed at unity of administration.
One is that they cannot have any voice in the
management of the estate, which Mr. Strutt naturally
works to the best advantage, and the other is that
only the savings of the labourer himself and his wife
may be offered for investment in the farms.</p>

<p>Probably there is no farm where such intricate or
such useful books are kept as on the Terling estates.
Practically every field is treated as a separate farm
in itself. Say, for instance, a field is to be sown
with wheat. It has to be ploughed, the cost of
which is charged in the book against that field, as
also the value of the manure used, the price of the
seeds sown, and all the time occupied in preparing
the land, and, later on, in cutting the wheat,
threshing, and sending it to market. On the
opposite page of the ledger is put the amount
obtained for the grain, and the value of the straw,
whether sold or used on the farms. A balance can
then be struck, and the profit or loss shown at a
glance. On the profit shown, those who did the
various necessary labours receive their bonus. So
with every field. But the system does not end here.
A most careful record is kept, for example, of every
cow&mdash;the original cost, if bought, the amount of
milk she yields per year, of her calves, and what
they fetch when sold, or their value if retained on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the estate. Every Friday, the morning and evening
milkings are accurately measured, and at the end
of the year these figures are added up and multiplied
by seven for the seven days of the week. In this
way it is known exactly how much milk each cow
gives. The annual average should be about 800
gallons, which is regarded as a very fair amount.
There is, however, one cow, Lilac by name, which
seems to despise that average. Last year her yield
of milk was no less than 1,457 gallons, which is a
big record, even on the Terling estates.</p>

<p>Mr. Strutt reckons that a cow should give on an
average 650 gallons of milk per year, and the
cowmen get a bonus when the yield of the cows in
their charge average that amount. The advantage
of such records are enormous. If a cow does not
give 650 gallons of milk per annum, she is at once
sold, as she does not pay for her keep. As there
are no less than 800 cows on the estate, the keeping
of such records involves an enormous amount of
work, but it is work which has a profitable result,
facilitating, as it does, the weeding out of poor dairy
stock.</p>

<p>The same attention is paid to other departments.
Records are kept of the sheep, of which there are
considerable flocks scattered over the fifteen farms
comprised in the estate. It is the same with poultry,
of which there are thousands roaming about the
farms, grubbing much of their food, but, of course,
some is thrown down for them in the various poultry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
yards. No hens are penned up on the estate.
While that course is necessary where prize-show
birds are reared, in the case of table poultry and
poultry kept for eggs pens are neither essential nor
profitable. With freedom the birds lay more
regularly, and are generally in better condition for
the table.</p>

<p>Asked as to whether eggs were not lost owing
to the hens laying in the hedges, Mr. Isted, who is
in charge of the office where all the various books of
record are kept, said that few, indeed, if any, are
overlooked by those responsible, because of the
system of bonuses given by Lord Rayleigh, to which
reference has already been made. Those in charge
of the hens receive a reward on every score of eggs
brought in. Every head of poultry reared also
means a monetary benefit to the workers.</p>

<p>Daily between 60 and 80 17-gallon churns of milk
are despatched to London. It is said that from no
station along the Great Eastern Railway line is more
milk sent to the Metropolis than from Witham. At
present about 100 of these churns leave the station
every day, all the milk coming from the immediate
neighbourhood. Eggs are also sent to the Rayleigh
Dairies in vast quantities. Every egg is carefully
tested before it leaves the estate. The poultry is
disposed of through middlemen. Other produce is
sold in the Essex markets&mdash;at Chelmsford, Colchester,
Witham, and Braintree. This would include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
all the cereals not used on the farm, and such hay
as was not required for the stock during winter.</p>

<p>Down in Essex wages are regarded as generally
good by the farm labourers. At least there is a
distinct tendency on the part of the men to remain
on the soil. Horsemen receive 14s. a week, cowmen
14s. and 15s., the head cowmen getting generally
18s. and 20s., while other farm hands earn from 13s.
to 15s. Living is very cheap, and rents are low.
A good, comfortable cottage, with a decent bit of
garden, where vegetables can be grown, can be had
for £4 or £5 a year. Should a man require more
ground he can get it at a nominal annual rent of 3d.
per rod&mdash;that is, a piece of ground measuring
5½ yards each way. Quite a number of men avail
themselves of this offer, and as they knock off work
at five p.m., they put in their evenings on their own
"estate."</p>

<p>It is true that Lord Rayleigh has only tried his
new system of investment, as well as interest in the
farms, for a year, but the results amply justify the
experiment. So satisfied are the men themselves
that many have asked to be allowed to invest their
share of the interest earned and their new bonuses in
the estate. It would seem that here, at least, is a
possible project for checking the ever-increasing
rush of young men to the towns, where, while wages
may be higher, the conditions are not conducive to
either personal or patriotic well-being. The great
feature of Lord Rayleigh's plan is that it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
distinctly profit-sharing one, for no reform, however
attractive, can be economically good unless it is
financially sound.</p>

<p>With wheat in a rising market at 50s. a quarter,
the granaries of the world holding back supplies a
considerable proportion of which are already
cornered in America&mdash;and bread dearer than it has
been for many years, the question of the moment is,
Can England become her own wheat grower?</p>

<p>Fourteen weeks after harvest the home supplies
are exhausted. Britain needs altogether, both
home and foreign, 30,000,000 quarters of wheat per
annum to provide her people with bread. Out of
the total area of 32,000,000 acres under crops of
all sorts in the country only 1,625,000 acres are
devoted to the growth of wheat. English climatic
conditions can be relied upon to allow an average
production of three and a half quarters per acre.</p>

<p>The solution of the problem, therefore, is
simplicity itself. A matter of 8,000,000 acres taken
from those devoted meantime to other crops, to
pasturage (to say nothing of deer forests, grouse
moors, golf links), or even lying waste, and
developed for wheat growing would produce,
roughly speaking, the extra 28,000,000 necessary to
our annual national food supply.</p>

<p>Millions of acres of the land at present in other
crops has grown wheat at a profit in the past. In
the sixties and seventies the staple commodity was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
at its most remunerative price. In 1867 it touched
the enormous average of 64s. 5d. per quarter, while
later, in 1871 and 1873, it stood at 56s. 8d. and
58s. 8d. per quarter.</p>

<p>With the countries of the East&mdash;India, China,
Japan&mdash;awakening to the potentialities of wheat as a
food in place of rice, with America's prairies
becoming used up and her teeming millions
multiplying, and with Canada, Australia, and
Argentina remaining at a standstill as regards wheat
production, it is clear that England ought to become
self-sufficing.</p>

<p>To attain the desired end the vast possibilities
of the agricultural science of to-day must be
appreciated and developed by every possible means.</p>

<p>What can be done within England's own borders
is the chief point to be considered, and some
experiments and experiences may point the way.</p>

<p>The first question is, would home produced wheat
pay? Farmers tell us that at 30s. a quarter wheat is
just worth growing, but that each shilling over 30s.
means about 5s. clear profit. Would not wheat at
40s. an acre be worth cultivating?</p>

<p>As to the practical ways and means of obtaining
this sum out of the soil, I must detail some of the
more modern scientific methods in agriculture.</p>

<p>I have said that 8,000,000 acres of the present
area under crops could make us independent of
foreign supplies. By applying certain simple rules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
of selection regarding seeds, a much smaller area of
land would give the same result.</p>

<p>Instead of 3½ quarters per acre&mdash;the present
average&mdash;the yield could be doubled, or even
trebled. Thirty years ago, in France, three quarters
an acre was considered a good crop, but the same
soil with improved methods of cultivation nowadays
yields at least four quarters per acre; while in the
best soils the crop is only considered good when it
yields five quarters to six quarters an acre.</p>

<p>The work of the Garton brothers and of Professor
Biffen, of Cambridge University, has clearly shown
that by careful selection and crossing of the best
breeds of wheat the yield can be actually quadrupled.</p>

<p>Hallet's famous experiments in selection demonstrate
that the length of the wheat ear can be
doubled, and the number of ears per stalk nearly
trebled. The finest ear he developed produced
123 grains, as against 47 in the original ear, and
52 ears to one plant, as against ten in the original.</p>

<p>In agriculture, as in other matters in which
England claims to take a leading part, we have
something to learn from the Continent. France,
Belgium, and Germany have adopted a system of
co-operation which has reduced the cost of farming
to the smallest possible limit. From a fund supplied
partly by the Governments of these countries and
partly by the farmers themselves, small farms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
manures, seeds, machinery, etc., are provided on a
co-operative basis. Would not a system on similar
lines have far-reaching results in this country?</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting suggestion, the
newest in the fields of scientific agriculture research,
is the inoculation of the soil with bacteria. Through
these wonder-working germs which live in the
nodules of plant roots multiplication of the free
nitrogen in the air goes on with great rapidity, and
this, united with other elements, forms valuable
plant food.</p>

<p>Recent experiments, the results of which have
not yet been made public, show that good crops of
wheat may be grown in the poorest soil; indeed, the
Scriptural injunction about sowing seeds in waste
places no longer bears scientific examination. On
an area which was little more than common sand
crops inoculated with bacteria gave an increased
yield of 18 per cent.</p>

<p>Wheat grown on the lines I have touched upon
within the United Kingdom, and paying the grower
40s. per quarter, would go far to solve every social
and economic problem known. There would be
work for all in the country districts, and consequently
less poverty in the towns, and to the nation's
resources would be conserved the enormous annual
expenditure on foreign wheat of £67,000,000.</p>

<span class="smcap">Strides in the Scale of Living.</span></h3>

<p>Earl Carrington, President of the Board of
Agriculture, presided at a meeting of the
Society of Arts, when a paper upon the production
of wheat was read by Mr. A.&nbsp;E. Humphries. His
lordship gave some very interesting jottings from
family history, showing the great advance that had
taken place in the scale of living. The subject of
the lecture, he said, reminded him that over 100 years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
ago his grandfather, who was President of the
Board of Agriculture, made a speech in which he
said that one of the most important subjects with
which the Board had to deal was the scarcity of
wheat. It was curious that they were discussing
the same subject to-day. His father, who was born
103 years ago, had often told him that in the early
part of last century they did not have white bread
at every meal, as it was so scarce. If that happened
at the table of old Robert Smith, the banker, at
Whitehall, what must the bread of the working
classes have been like!</p>

<p>In the five years from 1878 to 1882, said Mr.
Humphries in his lecture, we produced 117 lb. of
wheat per head per annum, and imported 238 lb.,
while in the years from 1903 to 1907 we produced
only 68 lb. per head, and imported 284 lb. For
many years British wheat had been sold at substantially
lower prices than the best foreign, and in the
capacity of making large, shapely, well-aerated and
digestible loaves the home-grown grain was notably
deficient. It was commonly attributed to our
climate, and people said that Great Britain was not
a wheat producing country. The real reason was
that farmer did not grow the right kind of wheat.

<p>The Hon. J.&nbsp;W. Taverner, Agent-General for
Victoria, said that he had heard a lot of talk about

baked from Australian wheat England had nothing
to fear, for the men would be equal to anything.</p>
